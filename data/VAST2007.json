However, some fad pets can be challenging to care for, and potential owners need to be careful before buying into the animal's popularity. Parmentier said prospective owners should be well informed about the pet's needs.No one should get a fad pet simply because it is \"cool,\" Parmentier said. They may not realize how difficult or complicated proper care can be.\"They might acquire a tiger cub, not realizing that it may weigh over 400 pounds when fully grown and be expensive to care for, as well as dangerous,\" Parmentier said. \"Others may purchase a small constrictor (such as a young Burmese python), not knowing that some species grow to be 16 to 18 feet -- or more -- in length.\"The chinchilla, one of the \"fad\" pets of the moment, will select a diet far too rich for him. They love pizza crust, cheetos, raisins, apples and the like. However these items given more than occasionally will soon lead to digestive upsets and loose stools. These upsets can be fatal.Diet-related ailments are common among fad pets because owners don't know the nutrients animals need, Parmentier said. For instance, a common medical problem among sugar gliders is sudden hind-leg paralysis, which is caused by calcium and vitamin deficiencies.", "date": ["1990s", "today"], "money": "400 pounds", "place": "MANHATTAN", "person": "Ted Parmentier", "organization": "Oregon State University"}, {"docID": "20030526-1_24", "docDate": "May 28 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "Life NewsPet-shop puppies might lack credentials 05/28/03My friend learned the hard way. Beware of pet-shop puppies if you compete in American Kennel Club obedience or agility trials. Several of my friend's dogs have earned advanced AKC obedience titles. However, a pet-shop puppy might not be eligible for AKC registration.                 When my friend went to a pet shop recently to buy dog food, she fell in love with a puppy of the same breed that she shows in obedience trials. When the pup was still at the shop one month later, she bought him. She assumed the pup was eligible for AKC registration. The clerk said she would receive the pup's registration in a month to 90 days. She should have received the litter registration form at the time she took possession of the dog. A few days later, my friend realized the dog's pedigree stated that his parents were registered with America's Pet Registry. To be eligible for AKC registration, a dog's parents must be AKC-registered. When AKC began requiring DNA testing as proof of lineage of dogs that have sired more than three litters in a year or seven litters in a lifetime, many puppy millers and puppy distributors started their own registries rather than comply with the AKC rule. There are more than 15 canine regis tries. Many of these regis tries offer nothing more than a slip of pa per saying that the dog is registered. Some even encourage giving \"breed\" names to mixed-breed puppies as a ploy for selling them at higher prices, to buyers who think \"registered\" is more valuable than a mixed breed. My friend will never be able to contact the breeder if she has questions about the dog's heritage or genetic problems. The breeder's address at America's Pet Registry is kept secret from the purchaser. In the case of an AKC dog, the breeder, who is also the seller, often becomes a mentor and friend for life. However, purebred dogs that are not eligible for AKC registration may compete in AKC obedience, agility and other performance events if they have an Indefinite Listing Privilege, more commonly known as ILP. AKC does not permit ILP dogs to be shown in conformation, a competition based on the dog's resemblance to its breed standard. To obtain an ILP, the dog must be a breed that is recognized by AKC. The owner is required to send two color photos of the dog to the AKC along with a completed application form and proof from a veterinarian that the dog has been spayed or neutered. Cost is $25. AKC's requirement for spaying or neutering prevents owners from continuing a line of unregisterable dogs. Conformation competition is not an issue here because anyone who is looking for a dog to compete in AKC shows would not consider a pet shop as a source. Puppy-mill puppies, which supply pet shops, are cranked out as rapidly as possible to meet demand. No consideration is given to carefully selecting a dam and sire so that the offspring will resemble, as closely as possible, the breed's standard of perfection. Nor is it likely that any puppy-mill dams and sires are tested for genetic diseases, such as hip dysplasia or progressive retinal atrophy, which should eliminate them from a breeding program. Responsible breeders do test, and this should be an issue for any buyer whether the interest is in pet, show or performance events. Two things have resulted from my friend's experience. She will give the puppy a good, permanent home for life. And she is wiser about pet shops.", "date": ["05/28/03", "one month later"], "money": ["$25", "$25"], "place": "America", "organization": ["AKC", "American Kennel Club", "ILP", "Life News"]}, {"docID": "20030526-1_34", "docDate": "May 28 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "On Friday 23rd May, the 2 adolescent female gorillas \"Brighter\" and \"Twigs\" were repatriated to Cameroon fromNigeria where they had lived for many years as pets in the northern metropolis of Kano. I'm sure you've all heardthe story by now, but the gorillas were purchased as infants by a Lebanese businessman who saw them in the marketand felt pity for them. He tried unsuccessfully several times to find permanent homes for them. The gorillas(ages 6 & 9 yrs) are products of the bush meat trade and are believed to be western lowland gorillas (G. g.gorilla), and not Cross River gorillas (G. g. diehli). They were smuggled, in separate incidents, into Nigeria asinfants, to eventually wind up for sale in Kano. In December 2002, they were put under house arrest by the federalMinistry of Environment as a violation of CITES protocols.After months of trying to coordinate the effort, the NGO Pandrillus was able to successfully carry off therepatriation on Friday. The gorillas were transferred from Mr. Paul Raad's compound to Kano International Airportcourtesy of Julius Berger Nigeria. They were flown on domestic carrier \"IRS\" to Lagos early Friday morning withPandrillus Director Peter Jenkins, Pandrillus Nigeria Manager Ubi Sam Ettah, Alhaji Bindawa of Ministry ofEnvironment (Kano), and Paul Raad of Kano. \"Jam Packed Cargo\" of Lagos coordinated their transfer to MurtalaMuhammed International Airport terminal, and loading into a Cameroon Airlines 757-400 jet for the 70 minute flightto Douala.A press conference was held by Environment Minister Dr. Imeh Okopido on the tarmac with Brighter and Twigs holdingforth in their travel crates.

Humane Society reported that her neighbor's daughter had thrown a dead dog into the trash dumpster. Animal control officers arrived at the scene to discover that the dead dog was only the tip of the iceberg. They also found an emaciated and disoriented 90-year-old woman. The floor of the house was covered with trash and dog feces, parts of the ceiling had caved in, and mildew covered the walls. Reports indicated that the daughter often left her elderly mother alone for several weeks at a time. The animal control officers rescued the remaining dogs and contacted adult protective services, which arranged to have the woman transported to a hospital. The two agencies coordinated their actions to meet the needs of victims of two different types of abuse?yet all of whom required emergency care. If it hadn't been for the report of a dead dog, the suffering of both human and animal victims would have continued unnoticed. Animal cruelty or neglect can often be a warning sign of other forms of abuse, including elder abuse. That's why The HSUS has joined forces with the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging to share information on the animal cruelty/elder abuse connection. We're coordinating our efforts around Older Americans Month, the period set aside each May to honor the country's senior citizens. The informational campaign is clearly needed.

Spouses represented the second largest group of perpetrators (19.3 percent).\" When a family member abuses an elderly relative's pet, the motivations may be complex.

Cruelty news will, of course, eventually spread via the vast internet, which services millions of concerned people,  and to the international print and TV media.   As the 2004 Athens Olympic Games loom ahead, the reports of pervasive animal abuse in Greece circulate and the ensuing global concern will gather momentum and as a consequence, wreak havoc on the  expectations and projected financial outcome of the Games.  This tragedy could so easily be avoided if the Greek government was truly willing to implement nationwide humane reform.  Greek officials disdainfully salute the world with their collective middle finger. To date, government action in relation to  nationwide  vicious cruelty issues are in what appear to be a perpetual state of inertia and bureaucratic indecision.  Legal humane proposals sit idle before Parliament and the defenseless animals are taking the proverbial bullet for inhumanity.  In the interim, tens of thousands of innocent, unprotected, forgotten, abandoned animals are suffering and dying agonizing deaths via poisoning, hanging and shooting; as well as  by starvation and willful neglect.   At the same time billions of dollars are being spent on preparation for the Olympic Games infrastructure, airport, hotels, a new rail system, hotels, security and not a \"drachma\" has been spent to alleviate the suffering of sentient beings.

Lives, noreven the safety of innocent animals fall short of the almighty dollar.\"Oh, Praise Mary Greenspun Almighty\"  or so she demands anyway.TO: The Las Vegas Media Community and Residents                             (seeking a knowledgeable hard hitting attorney for this case) It's not likely that many of you who live in the Vegas area will ever see this or have a singleidea that this huge scandal exists and is continuing in your community.  WHY?Because, the person in the very center of stealing your money is the woman who owns bothnewspapers and some of the TV stations in Las Vegas.  As in all crime stories, there is a 'boss' and the 'triggerman' or in this case 'trigger woman'.Janie Greenspun will play the part of the \u2018boss\u2019 here and her \u2018trigger woman\u2019 will be known asMary Hero who made her millions from the Animal foundation. These two women are about to launch yet another campaign to raise millions off the backs of dying innocent animals through deceitful and highly questionable fundraisingpractices they\u2019ve made so much money from over the years right under your noses.  It seems asthough using the poor animals to raise funds for their luxurious homes and lifestyles isn\u2019tenough.  Since the mainstream public in Las Vegas has no time to find out the facts, the two womenare now the likely candidate to receive the County\u2019s animal control contract in 2005 issued by theClarke County Supervisors - yes, the same ones who are under investigation by the FBI on severalillegal dealings and operations they have been involved with, USING YOUR TAX MONEY!!  One wouldquickly assume that the entire group is somehow involved in undermining the reputation as well asthe operations of the city. The Clark County board of supervisors is likely to award the contractfor animal control to her in 2005. There are other qualified entities in Clark County who would bemuch more suitable for this contract, but until the public realizes that the problems that theanimal facilities face is actually the fault of the community at large, the awarding of thiscontract seems to be a given. The county refuses to budget appropriately and nobody receiving thiscontract will be able to make the appropriate changes that make the difference until the communityis made aware of who is actually running the majority of the animal orgs and learn to makenecessary changes in their lives as well.   The simple fact that they have spent so much time in pointing fingers and accusing others of somany  things, proves three things:  1.these two women do NOT hold the safety and welfare of theanimals in the highest esteem and would rather divert the public\u2019s attention away from whatisreally going on , 2. they forget what they are \u2018supposedly\u2019 accepting the money to accomplish \u2013as if there just arent\u2019 enough animals to help, so they use extra time and  money to make this acompetition, and 3. the community is quite unaware that they are being \u2018taken\u2019 in this game theyplay.  NOBODY WINS, but the animals really loose. Now, it\u2019s not the millions of dollars they\u2019vemade from running the Animal Foundation for so many years. Anyone who can solve these problems ina community or our nation should be made a billionaire on the spot.  But the animal problemscontinue in Clarke County. This type of \u2018female\u2019 bickering  leaves the good people who actuallytry to help the animals, to fend for themselves and eat off the bottom of the barrel.  They arethe ones who will really make a difference, but are pushed aside and forced to close. Janie, the \u2018boss\u2019 is known to sue anyone who just might stand up and look as if they may bepointing a finger at her.  Many even suggest fear of personal injury or harm to themselves, shouldthey speak out.  One who is actually being the complete opposite of a caring individual is mostappropriate to describe Ms. Greenspun. Finally, one who needs to be exposed and stopped.The attempted ouster of  Hero came last summer just a few weeks after the entire management teamof the Lied Animal Shelter from 2001-2002 called for Mary Herro's removal as president.  This teamincluded two veterinarians, and three managers, and the former director of operations there.. They all stood together to blow the whistle on the fraud and mass killing at the Lied AnimalShelter, particularly after Mary reinstated her horrible daughter Stacy as the manager of theshelter.  The result?  More than 800 killings in just one month -- June of 2002!!  (The board diddemand and receive Stacy's dismissal.)Meanwhile, they raise money and hold themselves out as a no-kill sanctuary.  This while animalsare slaughtered just for having ringworm or kennel cough, or are killed in mass numbers out ofLost & Found - never even making it to adoptions - if considered old, ugly, or otherwise chosenfor death.

As in patients with cancer, the flies carried the mutation in some cells, and tumors consequently developed, Xu says. He then saved the flies from tumorigenesis by introducing a human LATS1 (large tumor suppressor) gene into a model lacking the fly homolog. His lab also generated mice deficient for LATS1; tumors developed in these mice as well.The work showed that an invertebrate tumor suppressor is also a tumor suppressor in mammals, Xu says. It also uncovered evidence that LATS1 is a negative regulator for enzymes that drive the cell cycle, he adds. Once initial studies are finished on mice or other small organisms, researchers sometimes turn to larger models, such as cats or dogs. Besides the advantages of size and longevity, diseases that affect humans will sometimes spontaneously develop. Haskins works specifically with these kinds of cat and dog models, running an NIH-funded resource that makes the models available for research.The animals \"come to us because they have been sick, so they're relevant models,\" he says.

Peter Presland's patch is the lower half of the South Island, \"from Ashburton to the Antarctic,\" he jokes. The Dunedin-based animal welfare investigator \u2013 one of five throughout the country in MAF's special investigation group \u2013 spends a lot of time on the road, looking into his share of the 1000-plus complaints the ministry receives each year.Eighty percent of these are minor, such as a lame horse. Of the serious cases, only 10 to 20 end up in court. He has been involved in two high-profile court cases in the south this year involving animals being neglected. \"The farmer's state of mind and the condition of the animals are invariably linked,\" he says. \"No one sets out to starve their animals.\" If the farm is shipshape, the problem is probably minor; if the farm's a mess, the farmer's life probably is too. \"He might have had a serious health setback, or his wife might have left him. Whatever the reason, he gets to the point where he can't manage and doesn't want to get up in the morning. \"He loses interest in everything, including his stock.\" No matter how bad the situation, Mr Presland always tries to work with the farmer so the animal problem can be solved.When the farmer has agreed to take the necessary remedial steps, Mr Presland usually leaves him to it, only following up with a phone call or a visit if his sixth sense tells him the farmer is bluffing. \"If that fails, if the owner doesn't do what he has to do, clearly there has to be a more robust approach, including the possibility of court action.\" Even better than fixing the problem is preventing it in the first place.The other part of his role is educative \u2013 \"spreading the gospel\" about minimum standards of animal care to saleyard managers, stock agents and transport operators as well as farmers. But major cases of animal neglect don't happen overnight. They start with small signs and that's when Mr Presland believes the farmer's community can play a crucial role. \"My experience is that other farmers in the area knew all along there was a problem and turned a blind eye.\" People saw their neighbour struggling but hesitated to become involved in case it was seen as being nosy. \"A phone call, a bit of a helping hand back then could have saved the situation.\"", "place": ["Ashburton", "Dunedin", "South Island"], "person": "Peter Presland", "date": "this year", "time": "morning"}, {"docID": "20030623_23", "docDate": "Jun 23 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "French anti-globalisation activist Bove jailed Radical Frenchfarmer-protester Jose Bove was arrested at his home onSunday and taken to prison to serve a 10-monthsentence for destroying genetically modified plants,his lawyer said.

She called him in from the fields because the electricity went off again in one of the long, low-slung corrugated metal sheds behind her, and inside, the temperature is rising. It won't take long for this to become a problem for the nearly 20,000 growing chicks inside. Without power on hot summer days, it's nearly impossible to keep chickens from overheating. When they're chicks, giant heat lamps keep the birds at a constant 88 degrees. As they get bigger, industrial-strength fans blow through the chicken houses, and an overhead fogging system intermittently mists them with cool water. \"The whole idea of the situation here is to grow 'em till they're fat,\" said Virgil Shockley, who raises more than half a million birds each year on Maryland's Eastern Shore for Tyson Foods. After 42 days, the birds will weigh 41/2 pounds and will become rotisserie roasters for supermarkets, one of the many specialized products that have helped the industry combat lagging consumption of chicken, bloated supplies and competition from foreign imports.This will be one of the last flocks the Shockleys raise for Tyson. The nation's largest poultry company is pulling out of Maryland, starting the process at its Berlin factory over the holiday weekend by reducing the workforce. Until now, trucks brought an estimated half-million chickens to the plant every day. This week, Wednesday deliveries will cease and the number of birds processed the rest of the week will begin to shrink. Farmers such as the Shockleys, who are hired to raise the chickens, wonder whether the three remaining poultry companies that operate in the state -- Perdue Farms, Allen Family Foods and Mountaire Farms -- will fill the void. Weighing heavily on their minds is whether, and how, Maryland's new governor will keep his campaign promise to make Maryland once again friendly to business. Their concern is, of course, poultry. Worth $552 million a year, chickens represent the largest segment of the state's $1.6 billion farming industry. When a giant such as Tyson shuts down a processing plant, it sends ripples across the state.Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) has said he thinks less regulation and more cooperation is the way to promote business and stimulate the economy. Environmentalists fear he is poised to let the farming community slide on the critical job it needs to do to stop polluting the Chesapeake Bay watershed. For poultry farmers, the fear is that market forces will prove greater than anything the governor could do to help them, spelling doom to the family farms of Delmarva. \"If you don't have poultry on the Shore, then you don't have farms,\" said Virgil Shockley, a third-generation crop and poultry farmer. When he found out that Tyson was leaving, Shockley called the company and asked whether they wanted him to grow chickens for their Temperanceville plant in Virginia. The answer was no. He started dialing everyone he could think of -- the county economic development board, other commissioners, agriculture specialists, other poultry companies. By the time he got to state officials, the message was already clear: Something needed to be done to ensure that Tyson's departure wasn't the beginning of the end of the poultry industry in Maryland. \"Who else do I need to call?\" Shockley asked Agriculture Secretary Lew Riley. \"Nobody,\" Riley replied. \"You've done enough.\"", "date": ["This week", "Wednesday", "summer", "sun", "sun."], "time": "midday", "money": ["$1.6 billion", "$552 million", "41/2 pounds", "$552 million", "$1.6 billion"], "place": ["Berlin", "Chesapeake Bay", "Eastern Shore", "Maryland", "Md.", "Shore", "Snow Hill", "Temperanceville", "Virginia"], "person": ["Allen Family Foods", "Jeanne Shockley", "Lew Riley", "Robert L.

I'm asking ALL members to plan on showing up on the steps of San Antonio City Hall this coming Thursday, at 11:00 a.m. to participate in a protest demonstration aimed directly at animal control.   If a news crew shows up (and I think at least one will) I will act as spokesperson for this demonstration.  No one needs to speak on camera if you don't want to.

And on both occasions, the saved dogs ended up at the Tri-County Humane Society shelter in Boca Raton.The latest incident was particularly heart wrenching, since it involved major emergency surgery that saved the life of a nearly dead canine, but left him with only three legs.The rescued dog, Twiggy, is now recuperating in a Tri-County foster home and is doing very well, said Jeannette Christos, founder and CEO of the society. ?He has gained 17 pounds, is very active and gets around as if he still has all fours.? ?He is sweet and loves kids,? she added. ?He will make someone a wonderful pet and is looking for a good home.?In June, an ?Animal Planet? camera crew was riding with a Miami Dade animal control officer when they found a stray female dog that had just given birth to a litter of seven pups in a storage shed behind a restaurant.Ed Hubbard ? who handles rescue calls for Tri-County ? was dispatched to bring the dogs to the shelter. Christos said Monday those pups have all been adopted, but the mom ? named Sweetie because of her disposition ? is still available.As to the latest incident, Chloe Leland, producer and videographer for ?Animal Planet,? was again riding with a Miami animal control officer to film an animal abuse case in that city. On their way, they spotted an injured dog walking on the side of the road. The dog could barely walk and hadn?t eaten in a long time.They picked up the dog and took it to Tri-County, where Dr. Bruce Tannenbaum of Regency Veterinary Clinic examined him. He weighed 37 pounds ? some 40 pounds under normal weight. He also took x-rays that showed Twiggy had at one time had a botched surgery on his hip. To walk properly and be free of pain and infection, he determined that Twiggy would have to be seen by a specialist.?At that point, we called Dr. Kenneth Moore, who practices out of Coral Springs Animal Hospital and is one of the top veterinary surgeons in South Florida,? said Christos. ?We were hoping that there was something Dr. Moore could do to help Twiggy, who was obviously suffering terribly.?He determined he?d have to amputate a leg, as the damage from the previous surgery was too extensive. Christos immediately wondered how Tri-County ? a non-profit organization ? could pay for it.Moore solved the dilemma. Saying he did not want to see Twiggy suffer any more, he agreed to perform the surgery for free.?We couldn?t believe what we were hearing,? said Christos. ?But the more we heard about Dr. Moore, the more we realized that he is not only one of South Florida?s top veterinary surgeons, he also sincerely loves his four-legged patients.?Dr. Moore performed Twiggy?s three-hour operation, and ?Animal Planet? filmed the entire procedure.

It wasn't the island's most gruesome crime: Similar massacres have occurred in the past. But for a few weeks on Martha's Vineyard this summer as rumors swirled and accusations flew, it seemed the whole island was obsessed by the question: Who killed Mal Jones' chickens? Partly it was the horrific nature of the crime body parts and feathers strewn all over the bloodied coop. Partly it was the accused. Sabrina, a beautiful 2?-year-old malamute-collie mix has a silvery tan coat and deep brown eyes that radiate friendliness, not murderous intent. But mainly the crime grabbed attention because for the first time, in these parts anyway, DNA was used by the prosecution to implicate a dog. Hair from the coop matched that of Sabrina. But was that enough to convict her of the alleged murder of seven chickens a crime punishable by death for dogs in these parts? Magid offered to settle the matter by paying for the chickens viewing it as a form of compensation for the trouble Sabrina's family had caused in the past. But she refused to pay the $400 DNA bill, saying circumstantial evidence did not make Sabrina a killer. Selectmen meetings are held in an old gray clapboard building and are generally relaxed and friendly: The secretary passes around raspberry and lemon tarts before they begin.

''So it really boils down to us making a life-or-death decision.'' In Sabrina's case, they voted 2-1 for life at least for now. It seemed an audible sigh of relief swept the room. The board simply approved Jenkinson's recommendation that Magid pay a $200 bond to be returned after a year if Sabrina doesn't get into trouble again. Magid also wrote Jones a check for $375 covering half the DNA testing and $25 per chicken.

A Chinese scientist doing grassland research in the prefecture says thatif recent desertification trends continue, Xilingol will be uninhabitable in15 years........... In the deteriorating relationship between the globaleconomy and the earth's ecosystem, China is on the leading edge.

Huge flocks of sheep and goats in the northwest are strippingthe land of its protective vegetation, creating a dust bowl on a scale notseen before. Northwestern China is on the verge of a massive ecologicalmeltdown.........While overplowing is now being partly remedied by payingfarmers to plant their grainland in trees, overgrazing continues largely unabated. China's cattle, sheep, and goat population tripled from 1950 to 2002. The United States, a country with comparable grazing capacity, has 97 million cattle. China has 106 million. But for sheep and goats, the figures are 8 million versus 298 million. Concentrated in the western and northern provinces, sheep and goats are destroying the land's protective vegetation.

The circumstances that created that epidemic exist right here. An infected cow was recently discovered in Canada--but not until after it entered the food supplyWe all know (or should know) that factory meat farming is violent and environmentally destructive. You don't have to be a vegan activist to be disturbed by the conditions in which most meat animals live and die. And you probably already know that a large percentage of pesticide use, water pollution, and groundwater depletion is caused by the intensive cultivation of grain used to feed livestock, especially cattle. The environmental damage caused by the cattle themselves--the enormous expanses of land required, the destruction of native vegetation, the problem of what to do with all that poop--has fundamentally altered entire ecosystems. So that every supermarket can be packed with cheap beef and milk, every town can have scores of fast-food chain restaurants, and most Americans can comfortably participate in the fallacy that a meal is not a meal unless it contains meat, we feed, pump full of drugs, and confine about 96 million cattle every year. We kill about 30 million.We would all be better off without so much meat. Still, the cattle industry has proved as resilient as most Americans are oblivious to the process by which that burger came to their table. Despite a decade's worth of bad news about beef, the average American still eats 66 pounds [in 1999], and beef consumption typically goes way, way up in the summer months. How many hamburgers have you had since Memorial Day?A new player, however, has emerged in this game and could force the issue and destroy the multibillion-dollar beef industry: the infective prion, the agent that causes mad cow and similar diseases. Unfortunately, prions also have the potential to cause human suffering on an enormous scale. The recent discovery of mad cow disease in Canada and a good look at the ineffectual efforts to avoid it here show that the disease is not far away from us at all.Meat Market PrionsUntil the 20th century, most people who ate meat either grew or hunted it themselves; the animals you ate lived where you did and ate what they had evolved to eat. Now, though, we have the factory meat industry, to which it is dif\u00decult to offer any compliments.

Pasta. Rice. You might blame them for your weight gain. Or you may have heard someone blasting them on the news. Contrary to popular belief, though, carbohydrates are not necessarily the enemy.Carbohydrates are found in grains, vegetables and legumes (complex carbohydrates) as well as in fruit, milk and other dairy products (simple carbohydrates). It's how much you eat of these foods - or any other type of food - that matters when it comes to weight gain. \"At the end of the day, weight gain and loss is a matter of calories. If you eat more calories than your body can use - be it from protein, carbohydrate or fat - you will gain weight,\" says Karen Miller-Kovach, MS, RD, Chief Scientist at Weight Watchers International.So why do carbs - and not fat-laden butter or cheese - have such a bad reputation? First, carbohydrate-based foods today are often super-sized. While a regular Lender's\u00ae Bagel weighs 2 ounces, many New York-style bagels from the corner deli can weigh 4 to 6 ounces, and more. And servings of pasta at many restaurants far exceed the 1 to 2 cup portion that should be the norm.Plus, eating a meal that consists mostly of carbohydrates, like pasta with tomato sauce, may leave some people feeling hungrier sooner............Choose a variety of carbohydrates.

Police officers stood stiffly in a solemn tribute under towering pines. Flower arrangements adorned the open grave -- some with bone-shaped dog biscuits attached. Faro, a Norfolk police dog shot to death while apprehending a robbery suspect last weekend, was laid to rest Friday in a pet cemetery in Virginia Beach. His send-off drew attention to the region's working police canines, trained to waylay suspects, protect police officers, search for people and, in some cases, sniff out contraband or bombs. It also highlighted the strong bonds between police and the dogs they handle, which officers take home to their families after shifts on the streets. Early last Saturday, Faro was killed doing his job. Police gave this account of the incident: The 4-year-old German shepherd was one of two police dogs who responded with officers to an armed-robbery call in the 9300 block of 1st View St. around 4:30 a.m. Robbers had forced a man to the ground at gunpoint. At least two suspects fled as police approached. Faro stopped a man, Patrick Marcel Davis, 25, as he attempted to get into a vehicle. Davis pulled a gun from a pocket and shot the dog. Faro's handler, Officer Jerry L. Nowell Jr., ordered Davis to drop his weapon, but he did not. Nowell fired, striking Davis in the foot. Another police canine ``engaged'' the man, who fell to the ground and tossed his gun to the curb. Officers arrested Davis, who faces charges of killing a police service animal, robbery, abduction and weapons counts. Faro and handler Officer Jerry L. Nowell Jr.. Photo courtesy of Jerry L. Nowell Jr. Faro's funeral service began at the police K-9 Training Range near Norfolk International Airport. More than 30 police dogs, some from agencies around the state, sat in three rows with their handlers. Police from as far away as Roanoke attended, as did civilians. Top police officials praised Faro and his comrades. Norfolk's canines work for mere love and praise and, in return, give their all, said Lt. Wally Driskell. ``These dogs stand for everything that is good and loyal,'' he said. Acting Chief Shelton L. Darden lauded Faro as a hero. A bagpiper played ``Amazing Grace,'' and more than a few in the audience sniffled. A police motorcycle escort led the mourners in a procession to Garden of the Pines pet cemetery in Virginia Beach for graveside honors. Faro was buried next to Lobo, a police dog killed in the line of duty by a car in 1983, and Iron, shot while pursuing a suspect in 1997.

The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is the original and only pet fountain with a patented free falling stream, that is most like the running water pets crave. The fountain was designed and patented by a licensed veterinarian, Dr. Mary Burns, to satisfy a pet's urge for running water. The fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it fresher than standing bowl water. The product helps maintain proper hydration in pets, an essential ingredient for keeping pets healthy. New to the UK, the Drinkwell Pet Fountain is set to be the latest luxury for pampered pets - and it has a serious side too.. Research shows that one of the best ways to improve a pet's health is to encourage the pet to drink more water. By using a 5-inch falling stream to break the surface tension of the water, the Drinkwell Pet Fountain continually aerates a pet's water with healthful oxygen. Aerated water tastes fresher and you can even see it working as tiny bubbles appear in the water. A charcoal filter removes bad tastes and odours giving the pet the best possible and most appealing way to stay hydrated! It satisfies the urge for running water and helps eliminate jumping on counters in search of dripping taps. The product helps prevent urinary tract disease in cats by maintaining proper hydration.

There were no hard figures but conservationists guessed there were around 200,000. Inside parks and reserves they seemed to be thriving. What no one had noticed was that they were disappearing everywhere else, and so were other predators. Wild dogs once roamed over most of sub-Saharan Africa. Now there are between 3000 and 5500, living in a tiny fraction of their former territory. Cheetahs once ranged over most of Africa and central and western Asia: today there are fewer than 15,000.

The short answer is people. People with guns, spears, poison and snares. \"People have always killed predators,\" says Frank. \"But there's only so much damage you can do with spears and shields. Now everyone has got rifles and poisons.\" The slaughter began when Europeans arrived, and a century later, Africa's predators are in real trouble.

Despite recent efforts to conserve it, most of the deaths, even inside parks, are still caused by people, says Rosie Woodroffe, an expert on the species. The dogs now number somewhere between 3000 and 5500 and are declining almost everywhere.The one bright spot is Laikipia in Kenya, where Woodroffe heads the Samburu-Laikipia Wild Dog Project. Wild dogs were eradicated in the district 20 years ago. In December 1998, Woodroffe heard reports of wild dogs moving in from Samburu to the north-east. By 2000, some dogs had settled in Laikipia and made dens. Now there are at least eight packs and more than 100 dogs. \"This is amazing. In 1997 there were only six populations of this size known in the whole of Africa, mostly in southern Africa,\" she says. \"These northern dogs are genetically distinct, which makes them a very important population.\"Wild dogs are a big draw to tourists. At Laikipia they have mostly colonised communal land where the other top attraction, the lion, has been wiped out. The local Masai people recognise the wild dog's potential to lure tourists away from commercial ranches and spend some time at community-owned lodges. Even so, not everyone is pleased to see wild dogs return. Although they rarely attack cattle or animals kept in bomas they will go for sheep or goats left unattended or guarded by children, and individual herders can suffer big losses, says Woodroffe. \"Several dogs have been shot, one speared, one I'm not sure about - and four killed on the road,\" she says.At the moment, the best way to protect the wild dogs is by an early-warning system. Many of the dogs wear radio collars and are tracked by aircraft, so Woodroffe and her team know exactly where the packs are. If there's a risk of an attack on livestock, the team radioes the local community liaison officer, who jumps on his motorbike and sets off to warn those in the dogs' path.", "date": ["1997", "20 years ago", "2000", "December 1998"], "place": ["Africa", "Kenya", "Laikipia", "southern Africa"], "person": "Rosie Woodroffe"}, {"docID": "20030922_28", "docDate": "Sep 22 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "...Imagine If You Could Import Tropical FishWithout Risks of Death On Arrival (DOA)Now you can.With Global Ways as your business partner and friend, we appreciate your business and we strive to provide the best freshwater fish and services.With professional packing and quality fishes, our DOA records have been shown to be less than the competition.

It's a tradition, though,that does not provide much support for the idea that they will achieve theirgoals, however much destruction they enact.ELF's main goal is to inflict financial damage on property owned by peopleseen, as an ELF statement has it, as \"profiteering from the destruction andexploitation of the natural environment\" - whether by urban sprawl, themotivation for the San Diego attacks, or air pollution, as with the Hummers.Thus they hope to hit corporations, and the government agencies that aidthem, in \"their pocketbooks,\" stopping specific eco-transgressions in theshort run but ultimately bringing down \"capitalism and the mind-set thatallows it to exist.\" So far they claim to have inflicted more than $100million worth of damage in eight years, which must seem a significant figureto them, though it represents only a small part of the net worth of thecorporations they target and doesn't seem to be doing away with sprawl,pollution or corporate capitalism.Their second purpose is to encourage more people to take similar directaction. \"More and more actions need to be taken,\" an ELF statement says, \"tocreate an actual movement that continues to grow to successfully stop thedestruction of life.\" ELFers are not much interested in making people awareof the abstract issues of development or deforestation or trying to helpmainstream environmental groups push through reforms, all of which theyscorn. \"With one night's work,\" as they put it, \"a few individuals canaccomplish what years of legal battles and millions of dollars most likelydid not.\"And that really is all that ELF is: people deciding on their own, singly orin small groups, to sabotage a target in their neighborhood that hassymbolic environmental meaning. It is not an organization. It doesn't have aheadquarters or officers or members, and it doesn't hold meetings ormarches. (It does, as seems inevitable these days, have a Web site.) Anyonewho wants to go out and set fire to an SUV dealership and then spray paint\"ELF\" on the wreckage is an ELFer, and the motivation will be presumed to beenvironmental and not, say, revenge or the insurance money.This style of activism was borrowed from a group called the AnimalLiberation Front, which began in Britain in the mid-1970s and spread to theUnited States, possibly by some of the same people.Environmental sabotage - \"ecotage,\" as it is sometimes called, or\"monkeywrenching\" - goes back in this country at least to 1977, when PaulWatson broke from Greenpeace to start the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society,which has taken credit for incapacitating illegal fishing ships andinflicting $2 million worth of damage to a whale-processing plant inIceland. And for a decade after its founding in 1980, Earth First!, likeELF, encouraged anonymous ecotage, but it downplayed it in the early 1990sbecause as a group with offices and meetings, it was too open to policeattention.Thus the way was open for a group like ELF. It struck first in October 1996in Oregon, where locks were glued shut and buildings spray-painted atMcDonald's outlets and a PR firm for Weyerhaeuser and Hyundai and a U.S.Forest Service pickup truck was torched. More than 70 actions took placeacross the country over the next seven years, perhaps the most spectacularbeing the $25-million arson in October 1998 at a ski resort being built inVail, Colo., over fierce local environmental opposition. If ELF's goal,however, is nothing less than the eradication of the capitalist system, itis unlikely that ecotage will be the means. The problem is not with itsanalysis, for indeed this is a system that depletes and exploits the Earth'sresources with scant regard for byproducts of pollution or extinction orclimate change. But - moral considerations aside - it is hard to see howlocal economic sabotage can be an effective method of change.ELFers may imagine that people will become outraged enough at our presentundoubtedly catastrophic assault on the Earth's environment to set fire toSUV dealerships across the country, but the historical record shows littlereason to believe that this would stop the production of those cars, muchless destroy the Detroit manufacturers or the economic system itself.Of course when your target is, essentially, Western civilization, it is hardto know what strategy would work.", "date": ["1970s", "1977", "1980", "1996", "1998", "1999", "19th century", "Aug. 1", "August", "October 1996", "October 1998", "Sept. 29", "early 1990s", "early September", "last week", "next seven years"], "money": ["$2 million", "$54 million", "more than $100 million", "more than $100 million", "$54 million", "$25 million", "$2 million"], "place": ["Britain", "Colo.", "ELFers", "Iceland", "Los Angeles County", "N.M", "Oregon", "PR", "San Diego", "San Diego County", "Sante Fe", "United States", "Vail", "Washington", "Detroit", "U.S."], "person": "Paul Watson", "organization": ["Animal Liberation Front", "ELF", "Earth Liberation Front", "FBI", "SUV", "Sea Shepherd Conservation Society", "U.S. Forest Service", "Earth First", "Greenpeace", "McDonald", "U.N."], "time": "night"}, {"docID": "20031006_48", "docDate": "Oct 6 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "A man claims a woman wrongly adopted his lost parrot and he can prove it if given a chance to question the bird in court.

The rancher permittee was thrown off the allotment in the late 1990s because he disagreed with government imposed cattle reductions and consequently refused to sign his permit. The allotment has been closed ever since.  This spring he put his cattle back on the allotment in defiance of the closure.  Despite protests by activists, the government has not acted against him (might have something to do with the Bush administration being sympathetic to ranchers).  Public attention focused on this allotment might motivate the government to act.I first visited the allotment in 1997, then returned last July to photograph the recent damage that the illegal grazing had done.  I have a photopage as supporting evidence for the \"overgrazed\" condition of the allotment (http://rangenet.org/directory/hudakm/diamondbar/index.html)2) Rock Creek/Mudholes Allotment (UT): Another allotment with ongoing legal action.  In 2000, rancher Mary Bulloch failed to comply with a government order to remove her cattle because of prolonged drought. After the government impounded her cattle, Bulloch arrived with about a dozen rancher friends who stole back the cattle.  For this reason and also because some trespass cattle remain on the allotment, Bulloch has accrued over $77,000 in fines and penalties.  Her case goes to trial in late November.

What are its objectives? I've been with PETA for four years. PETA was founded over 20 years ago by Ingrid Newkirk, and our headquarters are in Norfolk, Va. We have 750,000-plus members -- we're the largest animal rights group in the world. PETA believes that animals are not ours to eat, to wear, to experiment on or to use for entertainment. The underlying goal of PETA is to encourage people to be vegetarian. We work to improve the conditions of animals that are used for food, but, ultimately, we believe that animals should not be food. How long have you been a vegetarian? I've been vegetarian for 13 years and vegan for five years. I quit eating meat when I was 16 -- that was the year that we did animal dissection in my high school biology class in New Jersey. The dead animals were getting bigger and bigger, from earthworms to frogs, and, finally, the teacher brought out a fetal pig. That night, my mom served ham for dinner, and I was completely repulsed. I started reading \"Animal Liberation,\" by Peter Singer, and his arguments supported my gut feeling that eating animals was not right. What are your specific duties as national campaign coordinator for PETA? I work primarily on the antifur campaign. Our most recent action took place in New York City, on opening night at the Metropolitan Opera. People traditionally show their fur coats at this event, so we had 15 activists there who were holding the bloody carcasses of skinned foxes, and signs that said, \"Here's the rest of your fur coat.\" I love these kinds of demonstrations -- actions that are shocking but appropriate. The point we're trying to make is that each fox coat generates 40 fox carcasses. Last winter, we also did a fur protest in Park City, Utah. We showed up at the Freestyle World Championship wearing just ski caps and skis, carrying signs that said, \"We'd Rather Ski Naked Than Wear Fur.\" I imagine that you and other PETA activists get tons of attention when you don't have much on. Yes. That's why we do it: to get media attention for PETA's causes. I didn't like standing outside naked in 30-degree weather -- it's absolutely crazy! But we did it for the animals. Tell me about your Lettuce Lady costume. Did you design it? I didn't invent the costume. I am just one of many who have donned the Lettuce Lady costume for PETA. Our most recent Lettuce Lady is Pamela Anderson, who appears in the lettuce bikini in PETA's newest ad, to promote vegetarianism. I wore the lettuce costume in Singapore, in PETA's first-ever demonstration in that country, and I wore it on a tour through Croatia. I also wore lettuce in South Africa, in Johannesburg at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 and also in Cape Town. So, maybe, I have worn it 10 times. Lettuce Ladies hand out samples of delicious vegetarian food to show people that going vegetarian is not just good for the animals and good for your health, it's also good for your taste buds. Our mission is to encourage everyone to turn over a new leaf and go vegetarian. What about the Tiger Lady and Leopard Lady costumes? I didn't invent those costumes, either -- many others have preceded me! But I have stripped down to my leopard spots or tiger stripes to protest fur for PETA 50 times or so. Have you done Bay Area antifur actions? Yes. Last January, a friend and I painted ourselves like Leopard Ladies, and we skated around the Kristi Yamaguchi Ice Rink in Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco. We carried a banner that said, \"We'd Rather Bare Skin Than Wear Skin\" until security kicked us out. We give our local activists printed materials that they can give to people who are wearing fur, like this. (She hands me three cards with various messages: \"Fur Hurts!\" \"Whose Skin Are You In?\" and \"I Wear Fur; I'm an A**hole.\") We want to create a situation where people are uncomfortable going outside in furs because they might be accosted, because they should be. San Francisco is not one of the furriest cities in the U.S.A. -- New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C., are. But last year, it was noted in The Chronicle that opening night at the San Francisco Ballet, in early February, was a \"furry\" event. The symphony and the opera are also hoity-toity events where people who have furs might wear them, so I am thinking that this year, those places might be good places to show up with our little fox carcasses. I don't mind telling you this now, because we want people to know in advance that if they wear their fur there, they'll be confronted by people who are speaking up for the animals. Is there any connection between PETA activists and the Revolutionary Cells Animal Liberation Brigade, which recently bombed Chiron in Emeryville and Shaklee in Pleasanton? There's no connection between PETA and the Revolutionary Cells Animal Liberation Brigade, or with the Animal Liberation Front. We have no official stance on their activities, because they have nothing to do with us. We advocate going to any legal means to stop animal abuse, and we engage in civil disobedience, but PETA does not engage in violent activities. What about the recent foie gras incident, where the chef of Aqua Restaurant was threatened and his car, home and shop were vandalized because he's involved in foie gras production? Does PETA have a stance on that? That was also not a PETA activity, but PETA did do an undercover investigation at a New York foie gras farm. We saw an inflexible tube shoved down the throats of ducks and geese to force feed them a huge amount of grain. It was the equivalent of force feeding a human 20 pounds of spaghetti. They do this for several weeks. It causes a disease that makes the birds' liver enlarge. We got footage of punctured throats and esophagi, and the birds could no longer walk because they were so fat -- plus, they were injured because they had resisted the handling. Foie gras production is illegal in many countries -- it was just banned in Israel. Besides antifur demonstrations, what other activities is PETA involved in? We had a recent week of action against KFC, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5. We showed footage of their slaughterhouse, and we handed out leaflets at two KFCs in San Francisco's Mission District. KFC is the largest purchaser of chicken carcasses in the world, and we want them to tell their slaughterhouses to eliminate the worst abuses that happen there. PETA has been protesting fast-food corporations for a while. We started against McDonald's, and they agreed to our terms after several months of aggressive campaigning. Then we had successful campaigns against Burger King and Wendy's. We also have an antidairy campaign. We do billboards a lot, with slogans like \"Milk Is for Babies.\" Oh. (We both stare at the Thai iced tea I'm drinking. It has milk in it.) We also have billboards that say, \"Got Pus? Milk Does,\" based on studies reporting on the percentage of pus and other contaminants in a glass of milk. Oh. Ick. Huh. Humans are the only species that drinks another animal's milk. It's surreal that we do that. Lisa, does PETA have a huge antihunting campaign? We have an antihunting campaign, but it's not one of our biggest priorities. The small number of animals that are killed by hunters each year is extremely insignificant compared to the 40 billion animals raised and slaughtered annually for human consumption. Plus, animals killed by hunters had lives that were far better than those of domesticated animals that suffered in confinement on factory farms, deprived of any natural behavior. It's also very hypocritical for people to say hunting is immoral and then go to the supermarket and stock up on meat. Those people just don't want the blood on their own hands. You have done a lot of protest actions. How many? Between 50 and 100. It's my full-time job. I have traveled around the world doing different fur actions. Last summer, I was in Moscow for a while, protesting a fur convention there. I sat in a cage wearing a full-length fur cape, with a sign saying \"Summer Is No Vacation for Animals on Fur Farms.\" I also went to Athens, Budapest, Prague. Last March, I went to Hong Kong and Tokyo. In the United States, I have been to New York, Chicago, Miami, San Diego, Los Angeles, Huntsville [Ala.], Dayton [Ohio], Augusta [Ga.], Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Austin -- all over. Have you ever been arrested? Yes, three times. My first arrest was at Saks Fifth Avenue in San Francisco three years ago. The designer Michael Kors was having a trunk show, showing off his new collection, and he uses a lot of fur. So, I went with a big bag of play money that was painted red to look bloody. I poured it on his head and I said, \"Here's your bloody money, you fur pimp.\" I was arrested and charged with disruption of business, but the charges were dropped. I think technically I'm never supposed to go back to Saks ever again. My second arrest was in Las Vegas at a fur protest. I was dressed as the Leopard Lady, wearing just panties and pasties, and they took me to jail. Of all places -- it's bizarre to get arrested in Las Vegas for indecent exposure! The third arrest was last winter in Boston at a fur protest at Macy's. We were wearing fur coats with actual leghold traps dangling off of them. We covered ourselves in red paint, we writhed on the sidewalk, then we crawled over and painted the front door red. I was arrested and given a sentence of 30 hours of community service that I am completing with the SF/SPCA. Your job sounds fun. Do you enjoy planning your protest acts? Yes, it's very creative. We have weekly brainstorming meetings to express our ideas for demonstrations. This country was founded on acts of civil disobedience, and there's a proud history of it in many movements: women's rights, civil rights. Do bystanders get angry at you at your demonstrations? Oh, yes. Once in while, people get defensive: I've been called a few obscene names that you can't reprint in the paper. I even found a Web page that was titled \"Lisa Franzetta Is a F**ing Moron.\" Anyone who is a public face for PETA gets flak like this from our adversaries. When people are profiting from animal abuse, it is not surprising that they will sink pretty low to try to defend themselves. Do your parents worry? Do they like the PETA activities that you do? My parents are animal lovers, and I think they are proud of me, but I'd be lying if I said they didn't wish it was someone else's daughter who ended up sitting in a Boston jail covered in red paint on a cold December morning. But they agree with me that ending animal abuse is valuable work.", "date": ["20 years ago", "2002", "December", "Last January", "Last March", "Last summer", "Last winter", "Summer", "early February", "from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5", "last winter", "last year", "sat", "this year", "three years ago"], "time": ["morning", "night"], "money": "20 pounds", "place": ["Ala.", "Athens", "Boston", "Budapest", "Cape Town", "Chicago", "Croatia", "D.C", "Dallas", "Dayton", "Detroit", "Emeryville", "Ga.", "Hong Kong", "Huntsville", "Israel", "Johannesburg", "Justin Herman Plaza", "Las Vegas", "Los Angeles", "Miami", "Mission District", "Moscow", "New Jersey", "New York", "New York City", "Norfolk", "Ohio", "Park City", "Philadelphia", "Pleasanton", "Prague", "Pus", "San Diego", "San Francisco", "Shaklee", "Singapore", "South Africa", "Tokyo", "United States", "Utah", "Va.", "Washington", "Bay Area", "Houston", "U.S.", "D.C."], "person": ["Augusta", "Austin", "Ingrid Newkirk", "Lisa", "Lisa Franzetta", "Michael Kors", "Pamela Anderson", "Peter Singer", "Wendy"], "organization": ["Animal Liberation Front", "Aqua Restaurant", "KFC", "Leopard", "Revolutionary Cells Animal Liberation Brigade", "McDonald", "Chiron", "PETA", "SPCA"]}, {"docID": "20031020_37", "docDate": "Oct 20 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "In Seattle, a federal animal-research official suggests that the day mightcome when experimentation on chimpanzees is ended. ...You are excused for thinking that Seattle was on the verge of another WTOmeltdown last week.

The bears will live at the Wild Animal Orphanage in Texas, a nonprofit sanctuary that cares for more than 600 wild animals. \"When we walk back to the pens after they're gone, it will be like our best friends left. We'll miss them,\" Sarvey volunteer Jeff Guidry said. \"Everybody loves these bears.\" U.S. Customs agents impounded the bears and sent them to Sarvey in January after agents discovered 166 pounds of marijuana, worth nearly $500,000, stashed in a hidden compartment in the bears' trailer. Duane Christopher Bradley of Abbotsford, B.C., pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to distribute marijuana and is serving a 30-month prison sentence, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. When the two bears arrived at Sarvey, they were so overweight they couldn't climb, their teeth and claws were broken, and they rarely ventured outside their den. The 7-year-old bears weighed between 300 and 400 pounds, instead of the normal 200 to 300 because they were being fed whole turkeys. The bears, who were fed a healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, berries and breads at Sarvey, lost more than 100 pounds each, Guidry said. \"Our biggest fear was that they would be sent back where they came from. We were very excited to hear that they were going to the best place we can send them,\" he said. The bears, who now have shiny coats and love to play, will have plenty of space at their home in Texas, Guidry said. Corky and Pumpkin, who were apparently raised by an animal dealer, are so used to humans that they couldn't be released into the wild. Sarvey ensured that the two bears would stay together, Guidry said. \"They went through the abuse together and are bonded to each other,\" he said. \"When something is happening to one, the other gets very upset and tries to defend. They're absolutely inseparable.\" Their departure leaves room at Sarvey for other bears, but the cage will need major repairs first, Guidry said. Corky and Pumpkin will be picked up Wednesday by the Wild Animal Orphanage's \"humane train,\" a 30-foot trailer with transport cages. They'll then have a nonstop trip to Texas.

He had a good time in the car looking out the window, with his leg on the arm rest, on the trip to the clinic. Buffett enjoys his car rides, no matter where they end up. This isn't true for most cats. How often does your cat ride in the car? Most cat car rides end at the veterinarian's, groomer's or kennel - not destinations most cats look forward to. This can cause your cat to dislike car rides, or even being in a carrier, because these experiences are associated with unpleasant outcomes. Your cat may disappear when she sees the carrier, or become a demon cat if you try to put her in the car. To overcome these problems, give your cat small doses of carriers and cars, paired with good things. Put the carrier in the family room with a few pieces of tuna or other irresistible treats inside. Don't be surprised if it takes your cat a while to decide it's safe to approach this dreaded object. After she's going inside on her own to retrieve the tuna, put a few more tidbits in and close the door for maybe 30 seconds. Repeat this process many times, gradually increasing how long you keep the door closed. But don't close your cat in the crate every time she goes in - try every third time. Once your cat will tolerate her carrier for 15 minutes or so, follow a similar procedure for the car. With treats, a favorite toy or catnip in the carrier, put her in the car, drive around the block and come home. You can ultimately extend this approach to taking her to the veterinary clinic, groomer's or kennel for nothing more than positive greeting experiences. These kinds of desensitization procedures work best if your cat doesn't have any bad experiences with the carrier or car during the process. Even better is to prevent problems by starting these procedures as soon as you acquire a new cat or kitten. Many problems - including fights between cats, destructive scratching and not using the litter box - can be prevented with the right approach."}, {"docID": "20031027_21", "docDate": "Oct 27 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "A northwest Iowa farmer last week shot and killed a mountain lion, the first confirmed shooting of one of the animals in the state in more than a century.

Still, about 14 percent of Americans have traveled with a pet, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.Man's best friend - the dog, not the remote control! - is the most common of animal voyagers. An American Automobile Association survey reports that 78 percent of the people who travel with pets have taken Spot along.Fifteen percent have toured with Fluffy, and 2 percent have brought along their birds. Three percent have traveled with a ferret, rabbit or fish.Most of these trips were taken by car, though about 6 percent of pet-lovers have boarded a plane with pet in tow.According to the Humane Society of the United States, only a few cruise lines accept pets, and usually just on ocean crossings.Except for Seeing Eye dogs, beastie riders aren't accepted on most other modes of public transportation in this country. But check before you go.. . .Just because Rover is happy and healthy doesn't mean he longs for the open road. Leaving a pet at home - unless it has a problem with separation anxiety - can be the best option.If you have an adventuresome pet that travels well - or if you are the one with separation anxiety - go ahead and hit the highway. Just don't toss Princess in the back and hope for the best, though. Preparation is a good thing.\"Pets who travel frequently usually do well,\" says Dr. James S. Cloman. \"But there are always exceptions.\" Cloman works at Hanover Green Veterinary Clinic in Mechanicsville.One way to prepare for a longer trip, he says, is to take your pet on shorter trips to fun places - not just to the kennel, to get groomed or get shots.At www.petswelcome.com, packing a kit for the trip and also in case of emergency is suggested. Include items such as a supply of your pet's regular food, a blanket, a favorite toy or two, paper towels or newspapers, plastic bags (for scooping) and a container of fresh water (to avoid a sudden change in drinking water).If you're traveling with a cat or dog, make sure you have your pet's ID, rabies tags and medical history. Clipping Rex's nails also can help prevent scratches and upholstery damage.Cloman suggests transporting cats and dogs in carriers, if possible. \"It's really a safety issue. You don't want something jumping around you when you're driving.\"Once in the car, an overwrought pet may pant or salivate heavily. Cloman doesn't recommend sedatives for trips that last an hour or less because the tranquilizing effect lasts too long.Whether to use a sedative is a matter of common sense, he says. \"If they get very restless, get very vocal, try to escape from the carrier . . . you might want to try it.\"Always check with your vet before administering calming medications, Cloman warns. The dosage is extremely important, especially with very young or older animals.\"Another sign of nervousness,\" he says, \"is coming out at either end.\" One way to avoid carsickness or diarrhea is to feed your pet the night before if you're leaving in the morning, or offer a light meal in the morning if you plan to depart later in the day.It's generally a good idea not to feed your pet while you're in transit, though it should have access to water either in the car or at rest stops.If your pet is on medication, call your vet before you go. Some drugs, particularly antibiotics, can upset pets' stomachs when they travel. Cloman says it's usually best not to administer drugs right before you leave.When it comes to the restroom routine, he says, \"Most people know their pets' habits. Sometimes the pet has to go more frequently on trips because he's nervous or excited. Let dogs get out where they can be comfortable and walk around.\"And always make sure Rover's on a leash before you open the car door. \"If they've really got to go, they will. Give them the opportunity. If they take it, great. If not, you've done all you can do.\"Unless it's a 12-hour trip, Cloman says, most cats are really good about keeping their own counsel, as it were.Some carriers are big enough to accommodate a small litter box, he says. But most cats usually wait to go till you get where you're going.Some cats, Cloman adds with a laugh, won't do anything the whole trip except grumble.Letting your dog hang out the window while driving isn't necessarily a good idea. \"I have clients whose dogs never jumped out, but suddenly did, or had corneal injuries from rocks.\"When it comes to carrying more than one cat, Cloman says, there's no set standard. Some do well two to a carrier; some need space. Sometimes, even if they're in separate carriers, it's better if they can see each other.The best thing to do if you want to transport your pet via jet, he says, is to call the airline. Often, you'll need a health certificate, sometimes a number of days in advance. If you're leaving the country, check on quarantine and pet policies, as well as any necessary vaccinations.\"It's a big, loud trip,\" Cloman points out. Though most airlines now allow pets as carry-on baggage - if carriers will fit under your seat - some pets still must fly in separate compartments.\"They can be more stressed if their owners aren't with them. You can give them a sedative, but there's no one monitoring them, and that's not good,\" Cloman says. \"It's a bit of a compromise . . . but nothing I would let stand in the way of doing it [if you must fly].\"However your pet travels, Cloman says, there's not much you can do if it is extremely vocal. Sometimes a good, calming touch will help.But, he acknowledges, \"I have a low tolerance for noise like that myself.\" Fortunately, his dogs mostly snore when they travel.. . .Small animals are a, er, horse of a different color, says Dr. Larry Winters. Winters, who built Hanover Green Veterinary Clinic in 1997, has worked with wildlife as well as \"these other little creatures that have become popular [as pets].\"Winters usually recommends a travel carrier for smaller animals.\"We don't typically sedate them,\" he says. \"They don't usually need it. Rabbits and ferrets aren't quite like a dog or cat that gets nervous or upset when you change their routine. They don't seem to be as stressed.\"Of course, it can be hard to tell. \"Most of these animals don't vomit,\" Winters says. \"They just don't have the type of muscle in the esophagus that allows them to regurgitate.\"Be sure not to use too large a carrier. If you're transporting a guinea pig, hamster or mouse, for instance, too big a carrier allows the animal to bounce around, which can cause injury.Winters recommends lining the cage or carrier with a lot of bedding material. Unless it's a really long trip, don't leave food or water with your pet. \"They tend to burrow or bury food, then just eliminate in that and [the bedding] absorbs the odor.\"On long trips, a small water bottle will do the trick.Winters also suggests smaller cages for birds on the go. Bigger birds do well in carriers made for cats or small dogs.His primary advice for bird-lovers is to watch the car temperature. Too much air conditioning or wind from the windows, for example, tends to aggravate their respiratory systems.Snakes, Winters says, usually do best in pillowcases (just don't forget to secure the open end!). They can breathe through the fabric. Plus, he says, they like the confinement, it keeps their body temperature normal, and they won't be bouncing off the walls.The same goes for fish. Bag'em. \"Plastic bags are the best containers,\" says Winters, \"because they minimize trauma to the body of the fish.\"Tie the bag so the water doesn't spill, then put it in a box or big can to keep it upright.\"Fish travel pretty well that way,\" he says. Just remember to open the bag every hour or two and let in some air.Winters is a fan of containment in general. \"Cats not confined can really freak out,\" he says, recalling one client who was traveling with her cat and dog when the cat jumped in the driver's face.\"She rolled her car; the cat disappeared; the dog broke his leg; the woman was injured.

The author had a lifelong love affair with bullfighting and wrote evocatively of its \"spiritual intensity.\" But public opinion in Spain's second city has swung against the ancient sport, and talk of a ban is rife in the corridors of the city council and the parliament of Catalonia, the region that includes Barcelona. One senior member of Barcelona's ruling Catalan Nationalist Party said it was \"only a matter of time\" before an official ban was proposed and that bullfighting could disappear from the city \"within a few years.\" Opponents of bullfighting argue that the slaughter of more than 100 bulls a year for public entertainment is anachronistic and incompatible with Barcelona's ambition to become one of the world's leading cities for arts and culture. Animal welfare campaigners want bullfighting banned by the end of this year because they say it will taint the 2004 Universal Forum of Culture, a festival that Barcelona is hosting. Bullfighting has already been halted in several Catalonian towns, and in June the regional parliament became the first in Spain to ban children under 14 from attending corridas de toro. Opponents of bullfighting are protesting not only because of the \"cruelty\" of the sport but also as part of their campaign for independence from Madrid, the Spanish capital, where the corrida remains highly popular. One anti-bullfighting Bar-celona politician said, \"We are forging our own, distinctly Catalan identity based not on the outdated public slaughter of animals but on the arts, music and architecture.\" Talk of a ban is a red flag to bullfighting supporters.

As a result, targeted companies aren't just taking extra security precautions but also altering business strategies. The violence, which the FBI says suddenly became more serious this year, stems in part from frustration that peaceful protests have failed to slow the pace of biotech's progress. \"We've seen a drastic escalation in the use of violent tactics in the past year,\" said Phil Celestini, head of the FBI's domestic terrorism unit in Washington. A range of militant environmental, economic and animal-rights activist groups have used the Internet to organize around biotechnology, first in Europe and now in the United States.

An example is foot and mouth disease. \"It really wasn\u2019t until the (2001) outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom that the federal government really started paying attention to animals and disasters, and really started thinking about the tremendous consequences that livestock could have on communities in general,\" Heath says.He states impacts of an animal infectious disease such as foot and mouth are not just on animal health, but on social and financial systems as well. An example is the strong connection between livestock and feed grains. \"For every 100,000 cattle we would kill or would go off feed because of foot and mouth disease, the global corn supply would increase by 8%. That means that for every 100,000 animals that would go off feed here in the U.S., the global corn price would come down. That could have serious implications for developing countries and other corn and soybean producing countries,\" Heath adds.Heath explains we should develop serious and meaningful farm-based security programs to prevent the spread of animal infectious diseases.

A class of ?02 graduate of UC Santa Cruz, Chand, 23, had just moved to Virginia to pursue his career: campaigning for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. That was put on hold with the American invasion of Iraq. \"Here I am,\" Chand recalled thinking during a recent phone interview, \"living the philosophy of nonviolence and then getting called to go to war?\" But the vegan serviceman quickly found a way to reconcile his beliefs with his military action. A Sacramento native, Chand joined the corps at 18, right after high school. The challenge of going through boot camp that summer, he said, was just as exciting as the prospect of getting financial support in college. And while, he said, his young political views were unusual for a Marine, he enjoyed the chance to weigh his opinions against those of his peers. A defining moment in his thinking came during his junior year of college at UCSC. Sitting in the Cowell College dining hall one day, he was confronted by another student: \"She started yelling at me because I was eating meat,\" he said. Chand was so disturbed that he felt he needed to know more. \"I went and read ?Diet for a New America? to have argumentative comebacks,\" he said, referring to John Robbins? vegetarian anthem. Instead, the book turned him into a vegetarian. His senior year, a PETA documentary prompted him to go vegan and then to go out and spread the merits of his new diet. Watching the video made him think that \"animals have the same range of emotions as humans.\" Soon, Chand was leading workshops sponsored by an animal rights student group. Kerry Holliday, then head of the group, said Chand?s disposition helped him carry his message to a mainstream audience. \"He shattered that stereotype of the hippie vegan,\" Holliday said. After graduation, Chand moved to Norfolk, Va., to work full-time at PETA?s headquarters. Then came the war, and Chand served as a corporal on the crew of an Amtrack amphibious tank. His unit came under direct fire when it was ambushed in the southern Iraqi city of Nasiriyah, he said. His philosophy, he said, helped him put the horrors of war into perspective. After all, no act of mayhem could be worse than what goes on in slaughterhouses, or so he thought. He goes as far as claiming that killing animals is as immoral as killing people. Overthrowing the regime of ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, he said, was a good cause for going to war. At the same time, it gave him a chance to tell people about what is, in his view, the most important cause of all ? not eating animals.

A few years ago, you might not even have thought twice. But vegetarianism is on the rise and any number of thoughtful articles on animal cruelty, vegetarianism, and factory farming are making even dedicated meat-eaters think again about where and how their food is raised. To avoid fouling up your choice, whether bird, or un-bird, consider these tips and advice: * Organic may not be enough. Organic is increasingly big business, and many large organic farms resemble industrial farms in significant ways, manufacturing standardized product, in large quantities, built to ship over long distances. * Local can be better than organic. Many small farms are essentially organic, but don't always get certified and so therefore can't label themselves as such. Many also prize artisanal values over labels. Buying locally from such a farm, or from a greenmarket or specialty food store you trust, is often the best choice: It supports a small-scale agriculture, encourages biodiversity over standardization, and cuts down on the fossil fuels used in shipping across the country. * Cruelty-free is key. The world is rife with reports like PETA's on a Minnesota turkey farm: the farm manager was caught on tape bludgeoning birds with a stick and pliers and wringing their necks. More often, but hardly less cruelly, turkeys are kept in horribly cramped conditions: 10,000 birds in a windowless shed with less than three square feet per bird, the air filled with ammonia and responsible for many respiratory diseases, the waste-filled ground leading to foot ulcerations, the birds debeaked so they don't peck one another to death. Labels like \"free range\" and \"free roaming,\" minimally verified by the USDA, assure little besides some access to open air. Birds are scientifically bred for breast meat; this practice has grown so advanced that such turkeys have trouble standing upright, develop lame and infected legs and hips, are not genetically diverse and are thus vulnerable to disease, and can only reproduce via artificial insemination. They can't fly and can barely walk. They're pumped full of antibiotics and fed not nuts, grains, and grass but high protein food, including slaughterhouse leftovers. Then they are stuffed into crates, taken to the slaughterhouse, and electrically stunned, often ineffectively. They die when their throats are cut, often after reviving from their electric stun. This is the center piece you buy for a few cents a pound. When picking a turkey... If you are leaning toward servin turkey, and you have the opportunity, visit or call some of the small suppliers, and confirm, either visually or by asking questions, that the farming and growing methods used are those you approve of. Make sure that no pesticides are used on plants and that healthy, non-engineered animals are raised according to their nature, rather than in an industrial manner, and are slaughtered humanely.

A recent report by the international environmental organization Wild Aid revealed a series of gang-style killings related to the shark-fin trade in East Asia, a market dominated by Chinese triads.     In August, five person were killed in Fiji, apparently fighting for space in the black market. In February, a man sentenced to house arrest was slain in his home in Cape Town, South Africa, as part of the \"Chinese mafia shark-fin war,\" the report said.     The Russian mafia and Latin American drug cartels also participate in illegal wildlife trade, while some poaching groups specializing in smuggling plants and animals or their parts using drug- and gun-smuggling routes.     In Europe, enforcement agents have been shot in gunfights with gangs, and in Latin America, several drug shipments have been discovered mixed with animals or plants. Snakes with bags of drugs inside are just a sample, according to a previous report by Traffic, of the World Wildlife Fund.     It showed, too, that the past two Chinese anti-poaching leaders in Tibet have been slain and that anti-poaching teams in many countries are often targets of assassination.     This type of trade is attracting organized criminals because of the high profits (up to 800 percent in some cases) and the lack of serious punishment, which leads to an estimated trade worth at least $6 billion annually in the world black markets.     \"It's the most profitable illegal trade after drugs and guns,\" said Peter Knights, executive director of Wild Aid.     An example is rhinoceros horns, with prices of up to $40,000 per kilo, more than five times the price of gold, according to the organization Asian Conservation Awareness Program (ACAP). Not surprisingly, 97 percent of the world's rhinos were lost in the past 30 years.     Animals are wanted for food; for their skins, organs and bones; as exotic pets; or for traditional medicine in Asia. Several species are being pushed to the edge of extinction. The main markets are probably the United States and China.     In Cambodia, from 2001 to 2002, Wild Aid rescued 8,250 animals from illegal traders, helped apprehend 239 criminals and confiscate 1.3 tons of fresh meat and two tons of dried animal parts.     About 100 million sharks and shark-like fish are caught every year, and about 50 percent of them have their fins sliced off while still alive. Then, they are thrown back into the sea, where they sink and slowly die, so the rest of their bodies is wasted.     The fins are used for soup, an expensive delicacy in some parts of Asia, but finning has increased so much in recent years that fins are used even for canned cat food, said the Wild Aid report. ...    Wild Aid regularly intercepts poachers, prevents them from killing animals and destroys their camps. It also goes undercover with hidden cameras to expose the traders' inner workings.     The gangs involved in illegal trade often take advantage of small communities. People in these communities do the killing or collecting and sell their catch cheap to the gangs, which profit. A parrot, for example, can be caught for $5 and sold commercially in the United States for $500.     International organizations send speakers to Third World communities to publicize alternative products and inform villagers and police about how to conserve wildlife. In Thailand, the poaching of some species has decreased 70 percent with these efforts.     Campaigns in the media also have shown results. In Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where from 2001 to the end of last year more than 8,000 animals were rescued, 75 percent of restaurants stopped serving wildlife dishes.     Wild Aid also operates an animal facility to care for creatures that are injured or have been in captivity too long to be released into the wild.     Not all wildlife trade is illicit. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), signed by 164 countries, allows the commercial use of some species according to their extinction risks.     Noncompliance with the rules can lead to sanctions against trade coming from violator countries, said Simon Habel, director of Traffic North America. \"But [illegal traders] know what they're doing ? clearly, corruption is an issue too,\" he said.     Some methods of smuggling involve falsifying certificates or sending animals to a country where it is not illegal to hunt them, then re-exporting them from there.

McCartney has volunteered for the Cat Association of Topeka, 1719 S.W. Gage Blvd., since 1989. She also has served on its board for 10 years. McCartney has a magic touch with cats and is a licensed foster mom for C.A.T. When kittens need to be nursed to health or need to be bottle-fed, she dedicates the time to nurse them -- all with the ultimate goal of raising them and making them adoptable in the community. Janine McCartney has worked with the Cat Association of Topeka since 1989.C.A.T. is a nonprofit, no-kill shelter that opened in 1989. The agency moved to its current location in July. \"We renovated the building and did most of the work,\" McCartney said. The move took the help of many volunteers like McCartney. The cats and the staff are now settled in their new home -- a home dedicated to providing a safe place for the cats to reside until a match can be found for them. What prompted you to volunteer with C.A.T.? There was an ad in the paper when the association was getting organized. I attended the meeting, which was open to the public. I liked the idea of helping cats, so I started volunteering. I love all animals, but cats are easier to shelter. You could not have as many dogs here as you can cats. What is the best part of being with C.A.T.? Being with the cats. The reward is not in the paycheck. It's in perks, because they give back so much. There are a lot more people helping people than helping animals, especially cats. With a passion for cats, this is where I can help the cats. Coming here, I get to do what I like the most, be with the cats. The happiest time here is when someone comes in and fills out a pre-adoption form and walks out with the perfect cat. It's very rewarding. We have a lot of people who are dedicated. I've never worked so hard. You would not believe the things that people do to animals. That's why we're here. We know that the cats are safe. What do you consider your touch with cats? Fostering (kittens)... My goal is to bottle feed the kittens and get them to where they can be brought into the shelter and be adopted. The ultimate goal is always finding the perfect home. Sometimes that takes time. There is such an over-population of cats, so it takes quite a while before cats actually are adopted. Kittens are adopted faster. But some people do want adult cats. How do you keep yourself from getting attached (to the cats)? In the beginning I would adopt the cats myself. Then I got to the point that \"No, that's not what a foster mom does.\" I can love them, take care of them and I have taught myself how to let go. Now it works for me being a foster mom. For a few years, I would just keep them. They do such a good job making the right match, that when a cat is adopted I feel very confident. I felt that I had kept so many of the fosters that I no longer had enough time to spend with each of them. Now I can do it. That's the goal of the foster home to be able to take care of them and love them and let go. What does your volunteer work at the shelter entail? I work retail and I do kennels once a month. That's a lot of work. It entails cleaning, feeding and medicating the cats, if necessary. What is the most challenging aspect of being at C.A.T.? We get a lot of calls from people who are needing help. We can't help everyone. Knowing how to help people, knowing how to answer their phone calls and how to help each individual. What was the remodeling process like with the new building? We did most of the work ourselves. Part of the building was new and the rest was a remodel. We had an interior decorator volunteer her services and picked out all the colors. It's a lot of paint and was really hard to paint all those colors. The cats now have colorful rooms and furniture.

Hopefully many of you remember the email I sent out on Sept. 12, 2003, titled \"TN State Law is not being enforced\". It was about a case where there were 7 dogs, two adults and 5 pups, here in Houston County, TN, totally emaciated. First the Sheriff Dept. turned the case over to me, but when it came to enforce the Law, they refused, told me to leave the property, and, to top it all, the Deputy helped the owner in removing the animals from the same property, so there wouldn't be any evidences. I contacted the media, and asked for help to all I knew of, but no one helped! The thought of those poor creatures has been hunting me ever since. Last night, Nov. 1st, 2003, at 9:29 pm Central time, the 911 Houston Co. dispatcher, called me seeking my assistance in an animal cruelty case. I was put in contact with one of the two deputies at that location, and he told me that his supervisor, who is also the Sheriff's brother,  asked to get me out there to handle the case. A visiting friend of mine, and I left right away, and went to the location, which is only couple of blocks away from the location of the Sept. 12 case. Ironically I told my friend that it better not be the dogs! Once we arrived, I started to question the deputy to see if he knew, at that point, who the owner of the dogs was: SAME OWNER, SAME DOGS!!!! The deputy pointed at the small kennel where there were 5 pups, some dead, some still alive, and said that he couldn't go any closer to it because of the stinch. In the kennel we noticed moldy, and rotten dog food, a little pan with rain water in it, that was behind description, and maggots everywhere! Into a plastic container, resembling some kind of wast basket, there were two rotten pups, and three starving ones, that were feeding off the dead ones. There was no sight of the two adult dogs, although the smell pointed right at a parked vehicle. I demanded for the Sheriff, and/or the deputy brother of his, and/or the Assistant DA to talk to me and to come to the location. No one called. No one came. At this point the owner was threating us to get off his propery. The deputy tried to reason with him, and at last he consented to turn the pups over to us. Meantime, the deputy who was present during the Sept. 12 case, showed up, and we ended up just screaming at each other, because I made him look at those bodies, that he helped the owner with their removal on Sept. 12. Next thing, he was on the phone with the Assistant DA, and both ordered me to put the three pups back, or they would arrest me right there and then for theft, and trespass.  I have too many medical conditions to end up in jail on a Saturday night, especially when the Assistant DA himself  stated he would make sure I didn't get any help at least until the following Monday. We made it home at past 1:30 am, Nov. 2, 2003, with the above mentioned location only about 15 minutes away. We where there that whole time. I'm still expecting the Sheriff Dept. to come after me in one way or another. I'm begging each and everyone of you to help in seeking justice!!

But in the wealthiest nation in the world, there's no need to breed animals for us to eat when they can be reproduced naturally.Even if the FDA decides, after exhaustive studies, that it's OK to sell chicken breast, ham and pork chops that came from cloned animals, they should require a huge label on the package so those of us who want to bypass it - and I have to believe that includes most of us - can move on to the real thing.Otherwise, a whole lot of us are going to become vegetarians.", "date": ["Last week", "next spring"], "person": "Evil", "organization": ["FDA", "Food and Drug Administration"]}, {"docID": "20031110_14", "docDate": "Nov 10 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "Dog trainer Kasha Winston approached the 75-pound pit bull and mastiff mix, leaning toward its chain-link kennel in the city?s animal shelter. ?Are you a nice boy?? she asked in a sugary voice.

She heads off with her rabbit Jillian, as well as a fifth-grade student from the school, to visit the Mayo Healthcare facility in Northfield to brighten the day of the facility's senior citizen residents. Jillian is certified to provide animal-assisted activities and therapy to the elderly and disabled. \"I've had rabbits for the past 15 years or so,\" Bernardini said. \"I had heard about the positive effect pets can have on senior citizens, so three years ago I went to Middlebury to attend a Pet Partners training course.\" Pet Partners, established in 1990 by the non-profit Delta Society, based in Portland, Ore., is a program that establishes guidelines for person-animal volunteer teams to qualify them to enter hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities. The nationwide program registers teams that successfully complete health and temperament screening and volunteer training. Pet Partner animals include dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, domesticated rats, horses, and potbellied pigs. \"I took the day-long course with my Flemish Giant rabbit Emma, to learn how to become a therapy rabbit,\" Bernardini said. \"I worked with Emma on the things that we learned, and a year later we returned to Middlebury to become tested and certified.\" After passing the test, the rabbit became a regular visitor at the Mayo Healthcare facility in Northfield. Emma died last year and Bernardini adopted Jillian, an English Lop rabbit from Saco, Maine, a month later. English Lops are big rabbits with extremely long ears that alone are conversation stoppers. The teacher immediately began training the new pet, and on Sept. 13th she took Jillian to be tested for Pet Partners certification. Rated on temperament, appearance, grooming, obedience, and the performance of specific tasks, Jillian scored 35 out of a possible 36 points. Bernardini has resumed her schedule of visiting the Mayo nursing home once a week to work with the residents. \"Sometimes people who are shy and reserved seem to identify with a rabbit more than with a dog or another animal,\" Bernardini said. \"A therapy pet often opens up conversations about pets that the residents once had, and they become very attached to them. It's a change in their day.\" Bernardini also sees a positive effect on the children in her class, who take turns accompanying the teacher to the nursing home. \"It is good for 10-year-old kids to recognize the importance of volunteering their time to work with others. They enjoy meeting the senior citizens and talking to them.\" Mayo Healthcare Activities Director Kim Marcotte agreed that the visits benefit everyone. \"The rabbit has a very calming effect on the residents,\" Macotte said. \"There is also wonderful interaction between the generations.

The turtle had deposited 62 eggs in three holes, but by the time Herr returned she found the nesting holes enlarged by claws, probably from a marauding raccoon, and all the eggs devoured. \"It was so sad,\" Herr said.

Monitoring the breeding habits of the elderly turtles is just one of the latest efforts to improve the park's biological diversity and stem the loss of varying species of plants and animals. Volunteers and park curators spend thousands of hours each year on habitat improvement and scientific projects ranging from the low-tech sandboxes, used by turtles for egg laying, to the high-tech, water- and mud-proof radio transmitters fitted onto their shells. The curators have developed species management projects for each ecological system in the reservation. So far, those efforts have attracted more than 1,000 distinct species of plants, bugs, birds and animals, a level of biological diversity unmatched at any other county park. Park employees have encountered groups wading in the streams during picnics to catch and grill crayfish or gathering bags full of fiddlehead ferns for their salads.

Forestry officials and police recently raided three private zoos in Chon Buri, Uthai Thani and Bangkok as part of a government initiative to stamp out the illegal trade in wild animals and endangered species. The raids followed a crackdown earlier this month on a wildlife-trade ring based in Nonthaburi, in which a large number of rare and endangered animals were discovered, most of them already killed and butchered. The Association for Thai Zoos, which includes over 100 private and state zoos, called a press conference yesterday at the offices of the Zoological Park Organisation (ZPO) to demand that further raids be postponed. The association said many private zoos were awaiting official permission to breed wild animals and also urged the authorities to better distinguish between legitimate zoo operators and illegal wildlife traders. Association chairman Sophon Damnui, who also serves as ZPO director, said the raids had demoralised zoo operators all over the country, fearing their premises could be next. Sophon, said most private zoo operators complied with wildlife laws. He also called on members of the public to report zoo operators involved in the maltreatment of animals. Also present at yesterday?s press conference were association advisers Pisit na Patalung, secretary-general of the Wildlife Fund of Thailand, and Senator Jaroon Yangprapakorn, whose family owns a private zoo in Samut Prakan.

In a development that is likely to inspire both fascination and alarm, a Texas company said Monday that it would soon start selling a genetically engineered aquarium fish that glows in the dark.

Genetic engineering of animals has until now been performed mainly for scientific research or medical purposes, for instance to make mice that get a certain disease. Making glow-in-the-dark fish extends the technology into the realm of human amusement, which might raise some eyebrows. Indeed, an artist who made a glow-in-the-dark rabbit a few years ago as an artwork attracted criticism for undermining the dignity of life for trivial purposes.

A richer source of the way human social behavior evolved may be chimpanzees, with whom people shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 or 6 million years ago. From knowledge of chimp behavior, biologists can plausibly infer the social behavior of the shared human-chimp ancestor, and from that they can reconstruct the evolutionary history of human social behavior. .Such reconstructions are subject to much uncertainty and debate, especially when they imply a genetic basis of human behaviors like living in communities based on male kinship or conducting lethal campaigns against neighbors. But the goal is to shed light on the full sweep of human social behavior, tracing its evolution from an apelike community with separate male and female hierarchies 5 million years ago to the family-based societies of today. .A principal assumption is that chimps, unlike people, have changed little and so their social behavior is a good guide to that of the common ancestor. One support for this idea is that the earliest fossils on the human side after the split are very chimplike. Another is that the chimps of western and eastern Africa are hard to tell apart, despite 1.5 million years of separate evolution. .After 40 years of arduous study, biologists have put together a coherent, though not yet complete, picture of chimpanzee societies. From observations at several sites in Africa, there is an \"emerging consensus regarding chimpanzee social structure, territory characteristics and intergroup interactions,\" two primatologists, Michael Wilson of the University of Minnesota and Richard Wrangham of Harvard, write in The Annual Review of Anthropology. .Chimps are not easy to observe. It can take five years for them to get used to watchers. They must be followed, through hilly country, for 15 hours at a stretch. They can be dangerous. Humphrey, a male chimp at the Gombe National Park in Tanzania, nearly killed Wrangham by hurling a large rock at his head. \"He was just showing off,\" Wrangham says indulgently. A female chimpanzee at Mahale, also in Tanzania, attacked and severely wounded two researchers she considered to be allies of males that had killed her infant. .A major surprise has been that chimps turn out to live in territories whose borders are aggressively defended by roving parties of males. Jane Goodall, who pioneered long-term studies of chimps at Gombe, at first believed she was watching a single peaceful community. But as researchers started to follow animals throughout the day and watch their interaction with others, they found that groups of male chimps went out on border patrols, ready to attack and kill the males of neighboring communities. .The males in each community are related to one another because they spend their lives where they were born, whereas the females usually migrate to neighboring communities soon after reaching puberty, a practice that avoids inbreeding. This patrilocal system, of a community based on male kin bonding, is unusual, but familiar to anthropologists because it is practiced by most hunter-gatherer societies. .The males' operational strategy seems to be to defend a territory as large as possible so as to improve the community's food supply, which is principally fruit, and thereby their reproductive success. Anne Pusey of the University of Minnesota has found that the larger the female chimp's home feeding area, the shorter the interval between births. .In two known cases, a chimp community has wiped out all of a neighbor's males. Though the females may be absorbed into the victor's community, the goal seems to be getting rid of a rival rather than capturing females, since males often attack strange females. .Very few species live in male-kin-bonded communities with female dispersal. And only two practice lethal raids into neighbors' territory to kill off vulnerable enemies. \"This suite of behaviors in known only among chimpanzees and humans,\" Wrangham and Dale Peterson write in their book, \"Demonic Males.\" .Many chimp behaviors are ones people can recognize. Much of their body language - a mother holding her baby, the expression of an orphaned infant - is instantly readable. About 19 varieties of tool use by chimps have been noted, though each community has its own cultural subset. Chimps dose themselves with medicinal plants when they are sick. But where they differ most from human societies is in their sexual arrangements. .Males and females do not associate in families but in separate hierarchies. Males make females defer to them, with violence whenever necessary, and every female is subordinate to every male. A female chimp advertises her fertile period with a visible swelling and is then so pestered by males that she may get to eat only at night. But the great advantage of mating with every male in the community in a public orgy is that it confuses paternity, significant insurance given that males are liable to kill infants they know are not their own. .Males sometimes get females to leave the group and give them exclusive matings during a cycle. These consortships are sometimes forced on the female, who may recognize the risk to any infant conceived by a known father. .An intriguing variation on the chimpanzee social system is that of bonobos, which split from chimps about 1.8 million years ago. With bonobos, who live south of the Congo River, the female hierarchy is dominant, and males do not patrol the borders to kill neighbors. Though bonobos are almost as aggressive as chimps, they have developed a potent reconciliation technique - the use of sex on any and all occasions, between all ages and sexes, to abate tension and make nice. .Assuming the common ancestor of people and chimps had social behavior that was essentially chimplike, how much of that behavior has been inherited by people? The unusual behavioral suite of male kin bonding and lethal territorial aggression may look as if it has been inherited with little change. Among the Yanomamo, a South American tribe, the number of males who die from aggression is about 30 percent, the same rate found among Gombe chimps. .Not everyone believes that chimp social behavior is a good guide to human evolution. \"All these things are suggestive and point tantalizingly to things we want to know,\" said Ian Tattersall, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History. \"We just have to bear in mind that none of this is demonstrable in any highly convincing way.\" .But Robert Foley, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Cambridge in England, says a lot can be learned from ape sociality about the evolution of human social institutions. A community size of 80 to 100 people, typical among chimps and hunter-gatherers, is one feature inherited from the common ancestor.

The fish got loose from a fish hatchery operated by Cypress Island, a Norwegian-owned company operating salmon farms in Puget Sound. More than three months passed before authorities tried to corral the aliens. About 400 remain on the lam. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife records show 10 years of escapes from the hatchery. Its operation is \"pretty slipshod,\" said Greg Cloud, permit manager for the Washington Department of Ecology. Hatchery manager Dan Rotter said repeated vandalism of fish screens may have allowed the escapes and acknowledged he has not \"kept close enough watch on that.\" The company has spent $50,000 rebuilding its screens and installing security fences, he said. More than 1 million Atlantics have escaped farm pens in Northwest waters, some spawning in rivers on Vancouver Island. They have turned up in Washington's Dungeness and Nisqually rivers and in the Bering Sea -- 1,000 miles from the nearest farm. Fishermen have caught them in Alaska's Copper River, revered for native runs with deep rosy flesh. Ron Ginetz, chief of aquaculture for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, wrote in an internal 1991 memo that \"it is only a matter of time before we discover that Atlantics are gaining a foothold in B.C. or in Washington state.\" Ginetz now works for the British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association and says he no longer thinks Atlantics will take hold in the Pacific. It's a foreign environment for them, he says. Millions of fry were introduced in Canada and Washington decades ago to establish them as game fish, without success. But now Pacific salmon are much weaker, and grown Atlantics get loose year after year. Should they colonize the Pacific coast, they could compete with natives and undermine costly recovery programs. DEPLETING THE OCEAN FOR FEED Like wolves or lions, salmon feed on flesh. On farms, they swallow it in pellets made from ground, cooked and compressed fish such as menhaden and jack mackerel. But salmon are so voracious it takes three or more pounds of raw feed fish to raise each pound of fillets sold in the supermarket. That leaves oceans with a net loss of life. \"We're taking food away not only from salmon in the wild, but also from other predaceous fish, marine mammals and seabirds,\" says Jane Lubchenco, an Oregon State University marine biologist who advises world leaders on ocean health. \"What we're doing is going into a food web, tearing out the middle and acting surprised when the top comes crashing down.\" Not only Norway is swarming with escaped Atlantic salmon.

The PRCA has made tremendous strides in recent years in uniting the rodeo industry regarding animal welfare issues as well as establishing detailed animal-use guidelines. To ensure the welfare of the animals, the PRCA employs a full-time animal welfare coordinator to administer its welfare program and regularly convenes the Humane Advisory Committee to review animal welfare issues. The PRCA also established a Veterinary Advisory Committee in 2001 and requires that a veterinarian be onsite at all PRCA-sanctioned events to inspect all animals prior to performance and to provide any needed onsite health care.\"It is a terrific honor and we are very humbled to be awarded the 2003 Lavin Cup,\" said Steven Hatchell, commissioner of the PRCA. \"This is a testament to the hard work, leadership and guidance of many, including the PRCA Veterinary Advisory Committee, PRCA Humane Advisory Committee, rodeo veterinarians throughout the country and our own Cindy Schonholtz, animal welfare coordinator.\"", "date": ["12/2/03", "2001", "2003", "Nov. 24"], "place": ["La.,on", "New Orleans"], "person": ["A.

Fortunately, there are some things you can do to help prevent this from happening or, at least, ensure a safe return if it does.  Here are some tips to help protect your pets from getting lost: Spay and neuter all pets. Both males and females are much less likely to wander if they have been altered. Spayed and neutered pets live longer, have fewer health problems and are happier in general. Make sure all of your pets are wearing current identification tags. Make sure the writing on the tag is legible and accurate. Without any identification on your pet, they are helpless, may become homeless and your chances of recovering them are greatly reduced. Inquire with your veterinarian about getting a microchip implanted in your pets. There are several microchips available and your vet can help you choose which one is most prevalent in your area. Make sure your yard is pet-proof so that your dogs cannot escape. Also, keep any gates locked so visitors do not accidentally leave them open.

Click here to read the whole brief.For two hundred years, the United States government has refrained from prosecuting advocacy groups whose members occasionally engage in peaceful civil disobedience to convey a constitutionally protected message.The prosecution of Greenpeace indicates a sea change in that policy. Until now, only individual members of those groups have been prosecuted for their nonviolent, albeit unlawful, acts of civil disobedience. Greenpeace asserts, and there is reason to believe, that the government has selectively prosecuted it because of the content of its message. Selective prosecution violates the First Amendment and equal protection rights of Greenpeace; it also threatens every advocacy group whose message may offend the government of the moment.The government\u2019s radical departure from two hundred years of history invites the closest scrutiny. It has chosen to prosecute Greenpeace, an organization that regularly criticizes government policies, for the civil disobedience of its members. Using an arcane statute designed to deter the even more arcane practice of sailor-mongering, the government apparently seeks to silence Greenpeace, despite already having prosecuted and punished the individual Greenpeace \"climbers\" who performed the acts of protest aboard the vessel Jade.This prosecution threatens the very existence of Greenpeace, and because it appears to be based upon the content of its message, imperils the core values of the Constitution to which the ACLU and PFAWF are dedicated.", "place": "United States", "organization": ["ACLU", "American Civil Liberties Union", "American Way Foundation", "Greenpeace"]}, {"docID": "20031201-2_17", "docDate": "Dec 3 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "A surface mine might not seem like an ideal elk habitat.

We've been around long enough to know there's no such thing. But what you do need to know is that many of the problems commonly associated with aging can be prevented, if not completely eliminated, if you adjust your nutritional intake to the needs of your changing body.Speaking of changing bodies, did you know that with each passing birthday the human stomach produces less hydrochloric acid needed to digest food and properly absorb adequate amounts of certain key nutrients? By age 50, this dwindling supply of acid causes a vitamin B-12 inadequacy in at least one in four Americans; by age 75, it affects about 40 percent. What are the telltale symptoms of getting too little vitamin B-12? Memory lapses. Joint pain. Fatigue. Tingling hands and feet. Sounds a lot like aging, doesn't it? \"People often say, 'You're just getting old.' But many of the classic signs of aging overlap with the symptoms of nutritional inadequacy,\" says Jeffrey Blumberg, Ph.D., of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. \"Just because you feel that you're aging doesn't mean it's because you're aging.\"But don't go blaming your stomach for every midlife complaint. Fact is, you may be coming up short in the vitamins department?just like millions of others who have passed the half-century mark?even if you're eating a perfect food pyramid.So, how do you meet those needs? In many cases, a daily \"senior formula\" multivitamin supplement is all you need to fill the void. In other cases, even that multi may not be enough. Here's what you need to know:Vitamin B-12We talked about the necessity of getting enough B-12. Here's a case where that senior formula multivitamin has you covered. You can also get additional B-12 in your diet by eating meat.

What you want to do if you are not using protective wear on your dogs feet is make sure that they are really well rinsed off after a walk. That salt can really irritate their skin,? said Ecker. ?Also keeping the hair cut fairly short if you have an indoor animal.

The next night she flew through the house screaming and hissing at the back door. We saw an opossum at the door hissing. My kitty wouldn't relax for days. The vet gave her Valium. She was fine until she looked into a dark picture and saw her reflection. She went crazy!! Again screaming and hissing and urinating while she was running. Tonight for no reason, she went crazy again. I don't know what to do.    Dr. Nichol: Your cat's panic must be unsettling for the whole family. While a little fear is normal, some cats have a harder time because they are genetically shy. That possum looked and smelled really strange. Now your kitty is hypervigilant, waiting for terror to strike again.    You can turn this around but you must act quickly. Contact your animal control department or a local feed store and rent a Have-A-Heart trap. Bait the trap with some tasty garbage and humanely catch yourself a varmint. A scenic drive to the national forest will be this pest's one-way ticket to a new life. Next, fear-proof your home. Cover anything reflective with paper so that nothing can scare this poor cat.    Your kitty needs to feel safe. Medication can make a big difference, but be careful. A physical exam and lab profile are both important. Provided she's healthy, adding the antianxiety drug clomipramine will allow her to be gradually weaned off the Valium? a drug that can interfere with learning and possibly damage her liver.    Learning is your cat's ticket to a better life. Reward her with a treat? only when she's calm. If nervous or frightened, she must be removed from the threatening situation but not comforted.

Then, obeying her heart instead of her wristwatch, she whipped the car around, jumped out, scooped up the little creature with a newspaper, and slid it into a tiny cookie box, emptied for the emergency.

A study by the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust (WRFT) shows that otters caught and ate 28 per cent of wild salmon captured and electronically tagged as part of a radio tracking project on the River Ewe. Now scientists have called for the experiment to be repeated on a larger scale to discover whether any action should be taken to prevent the mammals' further impact on salmon stocks in Scottish river systems. The main aim of the project was to help the Ewe District Salmon Fisheries Board target areas of the river system that were in greatest need of habitat and stock restoration, but also to discover the relationship between spawning salmon and other wildlife. Twenty-five wild Ewe salmon were caught, tagged and released back into the river from June to October 2001. The River Ewe catchment area, which includes Loch Maree and the Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve in Wester Ross, is recognised as among the most spectacular and highly-valued natural wildlife habitats in Europe, and the freshwater fisheries are internationally famous. The WRFT report said: \"Our observations, together with data from radio tracking, suggest that seven of the 25 radio tagged salmon (28 per cent) were taken by otters between mid November and early December. The fate of two other tagged fish is unknown.\" It adds that, with salmon stocks seriously depleted within the Kinlochewe area, \"even a 10 per cent level of predation may impact adversely upon the subsequent recruitment of juvenile salmon\". Dr John Webster, an independent scientific advisor to Scottish Quality Salmon, which represents the salmon farming industry, said: \"If the level of predation of the tagged fish was as high as this report suggests, it could well be that the impact of otters [on the wild salmon population] has been dramatically underestimated. If you combine this report's findings about otters with the impact of mink, they may be taking a very significant proportion of salmon in the rivers.\" He added: \"It is very difficult to know what the solution to this is as otters are highly protected. However, salmon are also protected. There are a number of options, and otters can legally be trapped and relocated to less sensitive rivers if it can be proved that they are having a significant impact.\" Destructive control by culling was out of the question, he said, and something that \"no-one should condone or suggest\". Numbers of the Eurasian otter, the only native UK species, declined sharply in the early 1960s due to organochlorine pollution, but have recently made something of a comeback. Populations are still healthy in northern and western Scotland and the UK numbers are starting to increase, but are still a long way off census information from the early 1950s. The last government figures compiled in 1996 estimated that there were 6,600 otters in Scotland, compared to just over 7,000 in the rest of the UK. They were afforded legal protection in Scotland in 1983, but remain threatened due to habitat destruction, pollution and high road mortality. Dr David Carss, an expert on vertebrate ecology at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Banchory, who has himself conducted radio tracking research on otters, said: \"I guess we are into new territory now because salmon stocks have declined so drastically in the last decade. As more people start looking they are finding evidence that otters do predate large adult salmon just on the point of spawning or just after.\" John McKenzie, a part-owner of fishing rights on the Ewe and a member of the Ewe District Salmon Fishery Board, said: \"At face value it is a source of concern, that's for sure.", "date": ["1983", "1996", "Monday December 1", "November", "early 1950s", "early 1960s", "early December", "from June to October 2001", "last decade"], "time": "03 : 00 AM", "money": ["10 per cent", "28 per cent"], "place": ["Europe", "Ewe", "River Ewe", "Scotland", "Scottish", "UK", "Wester Ross", "western Scotland"], "person": ["Banchory", "David Carss", "John McKenzie", "John Webster"], "organization": ["Ewe District Salmon Fisheries Board", "Ewe District Salmon Fishery Board"]}, {"docID": "20031201_87", "docDate": "Dec 1 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "I am sorry to report the passing of R.

In this chapter wereview the brain's strategies for keeping track offast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this isby monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, orcorollary discharges. It has been difficult toidentify corollary discharge signals in the primatebrain, although in some studies the influence ofcorollary discharge, for example on visual processing,has been found. We propose four criteria foridentifying corollary discharge signals in primatebrain based on our experiences studying a pathway fromsuperior colliculus, in the brainstem, throughmediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in theprefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originatefrom a brain structure involved in generatingmovements. Second, they must begin just prior tomovements and represent spatial attributes of themovements. Third, eliminating the signals should notimpair movements in simple tasks not requiringcorollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signalsshould, however, disrupt movements in tasks thatrequire corollary discharge, such as a double-steptask in which the monkey must keep track of onesaccade in order to correctly generate another.Applying these criteria to the pathway from superiorcolliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that itdoes indeed convey corollary discharge signals. Theextent to which cerebral cortex actually uses thesesignals, particularly in the realm of sensoryperception, remains unknown pending further studies.Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstemto cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys,and some of these, too, may carry corollary dischargesignals."}, {"docID": "20031215_132", "docDate": "Dec 16 2003", "docSource": null, "docText": "A Dec. 9 story in the Main News section about a Web log written by animal-rights activist Virgil Butler contained several errors.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service voiced strong concerns that the plan would not provide adequate assurances to prevent wolves from becoming threatened again. Neighboring political leaders, such as Montana Gov. Judy Martz, admonished Wyoming to create a more balanced plan so as not to delay the transition of wolf management to all three Northern Rocky states.Expert criticismConservationists also believed that the Wyoming plan was too aggressive by allowing the immediate shooting of wolves. And this past week, in a process called \"peer review\" (a step in the wolf delisting process), a group of federal, state, and academic wolf experts from all over the country added themselves to the chorus of concern about Wyoming's wolf management plan.As part of the endangered species delisting process, Wyoming agreed that it would not rely on Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks to support all of its wolves, and be committed to maintaining a minimum of seven wolf packs outside of these protected areas. Yet under Wyoming's current plan, the Game and Fish Department has authority to regulate wolf killing only within the wilderness areas adjacent to the national parks-which covers just 10 percent of the wolves' range outside of the national parks. Across the rest of Wyoming, wolves would be classified as a \"predatory\" animal, meaning that wolves can be killed anytime, by anyone. Given these parameters, it is questionable whether Wyoming could maintain seven wolf packs outside the protected areas.Not surprisingly, seven out of the 11 peer-review experts expressed concerns regarding Wyoming's management plan.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington, D.C., was wise to halt action by the National Park Service to reverse a Clinton-era rule that would gradually remove the noisy, exhaust-spewing machines from the parks over two years.    The snowmobile industry lobbied the Park Service long and hard to get the ban overturned, arguing that snowmobile riders have a right to motor through Yellowstone and that manufacturers could produce less-polluting machines.    The Park Service argued that allowing 950 snowmobilers a day in Yellowstone and 400 in Grand Teton would balance the agency's dual mission of protecting the park while allowing visitors to use it.    None of those arguments swayed the judge, who deftly cut to the core of the debate in noting that the Park Service's primary job, \"rarely . . . trumped by other considerations,\" is to conserve the pristine natural beauty of the parks.    The air and noise pollution from snowmobiles are unkind to national parks and to all the people who manage to see them without ruining the experience for others. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a single, unregulated two-stroke snowmobile engine can emit as much pollution as nearly 100 automobiles. Models that manufacturers said would emit fewer pollutants have turned out to be more powerful and sometimes even dirtier and noisier.    Americans who want their national parks to remain places of natural beauty and tranquility oppose snowmobile traffic. More than 90 percent of the public opinion gathered by the Interior Department during the last comment period was against allowing snowmobiles in Yellowstone. Four former Park Service directors who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents urged Interior to enforce the ban.    Those who say the ban limits winter park access to skiers and snowshoers are ignoring the continuing operation of snow coaches that carry 10 people at a time. Coach passengers -- including the elderly, families and those with disabilities -- can view scenery not enshrouded in a polluted haze and watch animals not bothered by the noise from hundreds of snomobiles.    And it's not as if the ban would eliminate the machines from hundreds of miles of snowmobile trails just outside the parks.

The association and its allies have spent millions in recent years to deploy lobbyists defending its interests on meat regulations, inheritance taxes and other issues. So when a crisis surfaced that struck directly at beef sales, it had a plan.Washington lobbyists began tracking down members of Congress, who were home for the holidays, and discussing the response with officials at the Agriculture Department. Teams of experts in all 50 states were made available to the news media to get out the group's message. And the association posted a Web page, created years ago but held in reserve, to educate the public. \"We were trying to get to the American consumer, where all our money comes from,\" said Chandler Keys, the association's vice president for government affairs.The initial response was the first line of defense for an industry facing the largest test of its clout in years. It then embraced regulations imposed by the Agriculture Department on Tuesday, including an about-face on a provision the industry had long opposed and had defeated in the House earlier this year.\"Their barn is burning down,\" said Howard Lyman, a former rancher and lobbyist for the National Farm Union who is now an advocate for tighter regulations and a critic of the industry. \"They are trying to put the best face on it.\"--------------------------------  skip ------------------------------------. Critics of the industry say it was backed into a corner. \"They are on the run now,\" said Marion Nestle, who will step down as chairman of the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University in 2004 after 15 years. \"Countries all over the world are saying they will not buy their meat. That's serious.\"The association, which is more than 100 years old, represents most American cattle producers, as well as others associated with the beef industry, including restaurants and grocers. It has a long history of opposition to what it calls excessive government regulation.\"One of our philosophies is minimal government involvement and letting the industry address these things,\" Terry Stokes, the association's chief executive, said. \"More regulation increases costs and makes it difficult for small- and medium-size producers to comply.\"The association contends that the system in place to detect and guard against mad cow disease is effective, that this week's new regulations were an added precaution, and that anything new should be weighed critically. Officials often say any changes should be backed by science, though the industry and its critics often draw different conclusions from the available research. \"We want to make sure that anything we do has a practical and real effect,\" Mr. Keys said. \"We don't want to do things that are window dressing and political posturing. When you succumb to that kind of thing, it always bites you.\"Whether it can maintain that stance amid the threat of Congressional hearings, legislation and other forms of oversight remains to be seen. Like many heavily regulated sectors, the cattle industry has strong ties to government, particularly to Republicans.Cattle and livestock interests have given almost $22 million to political campaigns since the 1990 elections, with three-quarters going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance. Many say the relationship improved with the election of President Bush, who is the former governor of Texas, the top cattle-producing state, and owns a ranch there. Mr. Bush was the top recipient of campaign money from the industry in his 2000 election and again this year, as well as from allies like the dairy and meat processing industries.\"I love those cattlemen!\" Mr. Bush said when he met the association's president, Eric Davis, at a White House Christmas party, the association's newsletter says. Its Web site has a picture of the president at an industry conference.Mr. Keys said the association itself traditionally steers clear of the risk involved in presidential contributions, lest it back the wrong candidate. But he says his organization is firm in its support for Mr. Bush and the Republican Party.Critics of the industry, as well as those who have opposed it on issues, say it has been ruthlessly effective at knocking down or weakening regulation over the years. \"They are able to exert a lot of pressure,\" Ms. Nestle said. \"They are a very important American industry.\" Consumer organizations and animal rights groups that have supported proposals before the Agriculture Department and other agencies say they find themselves out-numbered by industry opponents. In Congress, lawmakers who have proposed legislation to regulate the industry say they felt the full weight of the industry's support.So it was for Representative Gary L.

The source of the toxin is unknown, but it is not directly   related to the imported fish themselves. The symptoms of   this toxin are predominately neurological when the packaging   has been handled: tingling of the hands, dialated eyes,   breathing difficulty and possibly euphoria. These symptoms   develop fairly rapidly, within minutes after contact,   depending on the length of contact and amount of toxin   absorbed. However, in severe cases, convulsions and even   death may occur.     The FWS has recently learned from the Florida Department   of Health that three Florida fish retailers have had employees   become ill from handling the catfish containers. In two   situations, the retailers could identify specific shipments   of cause, but the third patient reported several likely   sources. Further investigations by the Centers for Disease   Control and Prevention (CDC) may have uncovered additional  reports of similar illnesses in New York and California.     \"It is imperative that retailers not handle shipments of   ornamental catfish coming in from Miami,\" said Dr. Leslie   M.

Taking care of an animal is mostly common sense, but constant vigilance and attention to the animal is essential.\"Many of the health problems faced by our animals are induced by a bad diet,\" explained Kal-Downs, cautioning people to refrain from giving human food to animals. \"You must watch for signs of health.\"Indications of bad health come in many forms. Some of the ways to tell are in the animal's behavior, posture, the sheen of their coat and their interest level in normal daily activities. If your dog or cat appears to be healthy and shows an interest in eating and playing, chances are \"that's a pretty good sign\" of normal animal health.If the animal is feeling under the weather, the change in their behavior is noticeable. Instead of being active, the animals will usually be drawn into themselves and refrain from normal behavior. In some cases, this is the direct result of diet.

The disease, which literally eats holes in its victims\u2019 brains, has infected some 180,000 cattle in Britain and is blamed for the deaths of nearly 150 people there. The American meat industry needed to convince the public that its beef was still safe to eat \u2014 especially since dozens of countries had immediately banned imports of the stuff.Washington lobbyists with the cattle industry\u2019s main political advocacy group, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association (NCBA), fanned out to contact members of Congress and Agriculture Department officials \u2014 many of them at home for the holidays \u2014 to strategize a response. Association spokespeople were deployed in all 50 states to make the case to the media that the public was in no danger. A special Web site focusing on BSE \u2014 created years ago for just such a crisis \u2014 went up on the NCBA\u2019s official site, beef.org, according to spokeswoman Michele Peterson. Perturbed by all the images on TV of obviously sick cows taken during BSE outbreaks in Britain, the association hired its own crews to film sleek American cattle grazing contentedly in lush pastures, then sent the footage to the national networks, cable news shows and local stations.\u201cThis is all really a nonissue,\u201d insists Dan Murphy, a spokesman for the American Meat Institute, the meatpacking industry\u2019s trade group, which has also been busy downplaying public fears. \u201cThere is no threat to public health.

Over 40 billion chickens are killed worldwide each year, forinstance. \"The suffering of almost all farm animals is unique, particular,mostly beyond language to describe or explain,\" Masson writes. \"If we giveit no thought, and yet eat them for our meals, are we not morally blind,ethically dumb, and humanly remiss?\"The Pig Who Sang to the Moon is Masson's offering of intellectual food forthat thought, and his skill at serving it up produces an informative andcompelling narrative. He reveals the depth of the interior lives of farmedanimals, and highlights just how much they suffer from the brutality ofintensive farming and from being deprived of every expression of their basicinstincts and sensibilities. \"Not what you are eating, but whom you areeating is the question on my lips,\" Masson writes.In discussing each kind of farmed animal, Masson harks back to the feralancestors it resembles. He also notes how similar they are to human beings\"in their ability to feel anxious, bored, sad, lonely or deliriously happy.\"Pigs, whose transplanted heart valves can keep humans alive, are intelligentcreatures who wag their tails when happy and may die of terror on their wayto the slaughter they seem to sense is imminent. Their maternal instinctsare so strong that even sows confined to barren concrete stalls paw theground as if shaping straw into nests for their piglets.But farmed pigs, according to Masson, are \"fattened to immobility, tailscut, teeth removed . . . forced to urinate and defecate in their sleepingspace, something no pig would ever do in nature.\" Some are so heavy thattheir feet can barely support them. \"The pig's life has been distorted,perverted, deformed, contorted beyond recognition,\" he concludes.So, he believes, has the chicken's life. Chickens are \"treated as fast foodon legs, bred to be fried and eaten within seven weeks of emerging from theegg.\" They are crammed into wire cages that damage their feet and claws.They are deprived of all natural light, space to flap their wings and earthto take the dust baths that clean their feathers.There is no comfortable way to tell the story of farmed animals, andMasson's pain permeates every chapter. At the same time, his extensiveresearch, eloquence and reasoned approach to solutions combine to make thisbook toweringly important, and to legitimize Masson's personal mission asthe animals' ambassador to the carnivorous world.", "place": "Sang", "person": "Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson"}, {"docID": "20040112_67", "docDate": "Jan 12 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "The Animal Protection Institute (API), in conjunction with the Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) will again be working in Olympia to bring about passage of House Bill 1151, legislation that would ban the private possession of wild and dangerous animals, such as tigers, cougars, lions, bears, wolves, alligators and non-human primates.

The workshop, Thursday at the Amarillo Civic Center, featured Tim Reid with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Amarillo. Reid said that since Sept. 11, 2001, many aspects of agriculture are looked at for security reasons, including crop-dusting planes, feedlot security and the transportation industry. It would take an immense amount of chemicals, more than most anyone could get their hands on at one time, to contaminate many crops or even the water system, he said.

He was a medical doctor, had not been working for three years, but received substantial amounts of money in his bank account. The individual denied the crop-dusting conversations ever took place, but during the 12-hour questioning, he was deceptive in his answers, Reid said. Some cells may not be asked to do a terrorist act, but they may be asked to get information. For example, one individual in Amarillo was tasked only to take pictures of Pantex, Reid said.

The article looked at both the UK and the US. It is available on  the web in two parts at the following addresses:  Part One:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1104740,00.html  Part Two:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1104854,00.html  I highly recommend reading it, but will summarize it below for those who  don't have the time to read a 5467 word piece.  The article is headed, \"DAIRY MONSTERS: We used to take it for granted that  milk was good for us. But now the industry faces a crisis, with the public  questioning such assumptions. So just how healthy is milk? Anne Karpf  investigates.\"  Karpf notes that there is mounting scientific evidence that \"regular  consumption of large quantities of milk can be bad for your health, and  campaigners are making a noise about the environmental and international  costs of large-scale intensive European dairy farming.\" But she comments,  \"So thorough is our dairy indoctrination that it requires a total gestalt  switch to contemplate the notion that milk may help to cause the very  diseases it's meant to prevent....Today, there's a big bank of scientific  evidence against milk consumption, alleging not only that it causes some  diseases but, equally damning, that it fails to prevent others for which it  has traditionally been seen as a panacea.\"  She refers to the work of Frank Oski, former paediatrics director at Johns  Hopkins school of medicine, \"who estimated in his book Don't Drink Your  Milk! that half of all iron deficiency in US infants results from cows'  milk-induced intestinal bleeding.\" You can buy that book at:  www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0945383347/dawnwatch  She discusses lactose intolerance, which causes \"bloating, cramps, diarrhoea  and farts.\": \"In 1965, investigators at Johns Hopkins found that 15% of all  the white people and almost three-quarters of all the black people they  tested were unable to digest lactose. Milk, it seemed, was a racial issue,  and far more people in the world are unable than able to digest lactose.  That includes most Thais, Japanese, Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews, and 50% of  Indians.\"  Karpf notes that milk critics say that the idea that osteoporosis is caused  by calcium deficiency is \"one of the great myths of our time.\" She writes,  \"In fact, the bone loss and deteriorating bone tissue that take place in  osteoporosis are due not to calcium deficiency but rather to its resorption:  it's not that our bodies don't get enough calcium, rather that they excrete  too much of what they already have. So we need to find out what it is that's  breaking down calcium stores in the first place, to the extent that more  than one in three British women now suffers from osteoporosis. The most  important culprit is almost certainly the overconsumption of protein.  High-protein foods such as meat, eggs and dairy make excessive demands on  the kidneys, which in turn leach calcium from the body. One solution, then,  isn't to increase our calcium intake, but to reduce our consumption of  protein, so our bones don't have to surrender so much calcium.  Astonishingly, according to this newer, more critical view, dairy products  almost certainly help to cause, rather than prevent, osteoporosis.\"  She notes, \"American women are among the biggest consumers of calcium in the  world, yet still have one of the highest levels of osteoporosis in the  world\" and that \"Most Chinese people eat and drink no dairy products and...  consume only half the calcium of Americans.\" Yet \"osteoporosis is uncommon  in China despite an average life expectancy of 70.\" Further, \"In South  Africa, Bantu women who eat mostly plant protein and only 200-350mg of  calcium a day have virtually no osteoporosis, despite bearing on average six  children and breastfeeding for prolonged periods. Their African-American  brothers and sisters, who ingest on average more than 1,000mg of calcium a  day, are nine times more likely to experience hip fractures.\"  She quotes T Colin Campbell, the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of  Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University: \"The association between the  intake of animal protein and fracture rates appears to be as strong as that  between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.\" Another quote from Campbell  associates milk consumption with an increased risk of cancer: \"Cows' milk  protein may be the single most significant chemical carcinogen to which  humans are exposed\".  Karpf discusses the conflicts of interest that have led to milk's status as  the perfect food despite much scientific evidence to the contrary:  \"Another reason why official policy on milk is often at odds with medical  evidence lies in the conflict of government role, both in Britain and the  US. The US department of agriculture, for example, has the twin, and often  mutually incompatible, tasks of promoting agricultural products and  providing dietary advice. In 2000, it was still recommending two to three  servings of dairy products a day, to the rage of critics such as the  Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. PCRM claimed that six of the  11-member drafting panel had close ties with the meat, egg and dairy  industries (five of them with dairy).  \"Britain isn't free from conflict of interest, either. The government is  heavily involved in encouraging us to drink milk.\"  Karpf criticizes the UK's National Dairy Council advertisements, commenting,  \"Of course, it's no crime for the industry to promote itself; what's  disturbing is its masquerading as a disinterested source of incontrovertible  information.\"  Karpf feels that perhaps the \"most insidious dimension of the dairy  fightback is funding research.\"  The article discusses animal welfare concerns in detail. She starts with  \"the vegetarian fallacy\" which allows people to separate the dairy and veal  industries:  \"Alongside the researchers raising questions about milk sits the more  inflammatory animal rights movement, which has recently focused its  attention on dairy farming and what it argues is its intrinsic cruelty. For  a long time, those concerned about animal welfare seemed magically to exempt  milk from their preoccupations. They suffered from what Richard Young of the  Soil Association calls 'the vegetarian fallacy': non-meat-eaters who still  drink milk and so perpetuate the cycle that ends in crated veal calves  destined for European dinner tables. Now many of them have begun to contend  that, organic or not, there's no such thing as humane milk. For in order to  lactate, cows - like humans - first have to get pregnant. Calves are  essentially the waste by-product of the industry. What happens to them once  they've done what they were created to do - stimulate a cow's milk  production by the very fact of their being conceived?  \"Male udderless cows are of no value to the dairy industry, so if prices for  male calves are low and the veal route unprofitable, most are killed within  a couple of weeks for baby food or pies, to make rennet, or sent to  rendering plants to be turned into tallow or grease or, in other countries,  animal feed. Female calves, on the other hand, are bred as replacement stock  for their mothers. The provision of beef essentially originates in the dairy  industry: if we didn't drink milk, we wouldn't have all that extra meat to  get rid of.  \"Though a male calf's life is unenviable, its mother's is no better. To  ensure almost continuous lactation, she endures annual pregnancies. Her calf  is removed from her within 24 hours of its birth. Calves hardly ever drink  their mother's milk.  She goes on to discuss the exhaustive exploitation of the cows' bodies:  \"Like agribusinesses everywhere, milk producers have tried to increase  output while cutting costs. The victims are the cows. Today, from the age of  two, they're expected to produce up to 10,000 litres of milk during their  10-month lactation stint (before they dry off, are re-inseminated and the  whole process starts up again). Milked once or twice (or even three times)  daily while pregnant, they produce around 20 litres a day, 10 times as much  as they'd need to feed a calf. The amount of milk cows are required to make  each day has almost doubled in the past 30 years, because having a smaller  number of high-yielding cows reduces a farmer's feed, fertiliser, equipment,  labour and capital costs. That's why the variety of cattle breeds in Europe  has declined so much - everyone wants the high-yielding black-and-white  Holstein-Friesens.  \"You don't need to be sentimental about animals to pity the poor bloated  creatures, dragging around their vast, abnormally heavy udders. Many each  year go lame, and they rarely live longer than four or five years, compared  with a natural lifespan of around 25 years. Then they are slaughtered.  And she notes the pain of mastitis and its impact on human health:  \"The official view is that not only do dairy farmers care about their cows,  but that it's in their interests to keep them healthy. The reality is that  overmilking, problems with cleanliness and the choice of high-yielding  breeds together cause more than 30 incidents of mastitis per 100 British  cows each year. Mastitis is a painful infection of the udder. Cows' mastitis  has implications for human health, too, because to control infection farmers  use more antibiotics.\"  Finally, Karpf discusses government efforts to protect the dairy industry,  such as the food disparagement acts introduced in 13 US states, and the UK's  Common Agricultural Policy, which she writes is so absurd it \"will have you  thinking you've woken up in the middle of a Dali painting.\" She details the  ways in which the government props up the dairy industry at the expense of  small-scale farms in developing countries, human health, and animal welfare.  She asks what the alternative might be, and notes that people don't want  their eating habits policed.  \"Yet,\" she writes, \"what we eat and drink  isn't just the result of individual choice and cultural tradition: the  contents of our shopping trolleys are at least equally shaped by government  policy and official decisions.\"  She quotes Dr Tim Lobstein, co-director of the Food Commission, an  independent watchdog on food issues, who \"advocates the removal of all EU  subsidies from dairy production, with the money going to support sustainable  forms of food production, including some organic dairy farming.\" He  comments, with regard to struggling dairy farmers: \"I can't help to stay in  business the producers of commodities that aren't helping human health -  they'll have to find alternative employment. The EU should help farmers  transfer to products more helpful to human health, such as horticulture.\"  Karpf calls for a national debate on milk production and consumption. She  writes, \"Part of this debate will have to be a frank appraisal of whether  milk can jeopardise human health.... it seems increasingly clear that dairy  products alone probably don't protect bone health in the way we've long  thought, and that calcium intake on its own has only a small effect on bone  density.\"  The article concludes: \"At the same time (and Atkins notwithstanding), while  some fats are essential, the human body does not thrive on excessive amounts  of milk fat. Yet milk's connotations are so primordial, its associations so  pastoral and the interests that promote it so enormous, that changing the  way we think about it, and drink it, will be a process every bit as  challenging and root-and-branch as the loss of unquestioning religious  faith.\"", "date": ["1965", "2000", "5467", "Saturday, December 13", "Today", "past 30 years"], "place": ["Africa", "Bantu", "Britain", "China", "Europe", "US", "South Africa", "Holstein", "UK"], "person": ["Anne Karpf", "Frank Oski", "Richard Young", "Tim Lobstein", "Atkins"], "organization": ["Cornell University", "EU", "Food Commission", "Guardian ( UK )", "Jacob Gould Schurman", "National Dairy Council", "Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine", "Soil Association", "PCRM"]}, {"docID": "20040119_56", "docDate": "Jan 19 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "A recent census of the Virunga Volcanoes mountain gorilla population has found that it has increased by 17 percent, according to conservation authorities in Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Wildlife Conservation Society and other organizations.

It's not unusual for a purebred dog in a Nebraska shelter to be driven to a rescue service in Chicago that has an available foster home. Arranging transportation to permanent adoptive homes is also common. For the most part, these transports involve one or two dogs at a time, from a shelter to a rescue service, from one rescue to another, or from a rescue to a pre-approved adoptive home. The latter is becoming more common as the Internet helps breed rescue groups in different areas do reference and home checks for one another. About two-thirds of the messages posted on rescue email lists are requests for home checks and transport arrangements for individual dogs.Also assisted by the Internet, entire groups devoted to transport have been created. Manned by volunteers unable to foster dogs themselves but wanting to help in other ways, the best known and most professional of these groups is the Canine Underground Railroad (CUR). CUR volunteers must meet strict membership criteria, undergo background checks, and provide references. The dogs transported must also meet a standard of temperament and health, and have had pre-travel medical care such as vet exams, vaccinations, and spay or neuter. On the increase, however, are transport programs that are literally cleaning out shelters in one part of the country and bringing dogs en masse for placement in another. This practice began about 10 years ago when New York's North Shore Animal League began retrieving mixed breed puppies from rural shelters in southern states and bringing them north for placement. There was, the shelter alleged, a shortage of puppies in New York thanks to aggressive spay/neuter programs and reduced breeding. NSAL provided financial grants in exchange for puppies so the shelters could establish their own spay/neuter programs. This philosophy soon spread to other large shelters in the northeast that began making treks down south to relieve their own shortages.", "date": ["10 years ago", "December 2003"], "place": ["Chicago", "Nebraska", "New York"], "organization": ["CUR", "Canine Underground Railroad", "North Shore Animal League"]}, {"docID": "20040119_61", "docDate": "Jan 19 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Attention Chicago dog owners!

The stripping devices used innonkosher meat processing make it likely that spinal chord or other nervetissue will end up in ground or processed beef, while kosher processors donot use such mechanisms....Of course, if the mad cow furor gets any worse than it is now, people whohave gotten a quick and not-so-pleasant education in the meat industrymight opt for something even safer than keeping kosher ? vegetarianism.", "date": ["1990s", "2002", "late December"], "place": ["England", "Holstein", "Israel", "Washington"], "person": "Eliezer Eidlitz", "organization": ["Department of Agriculture", "Kosher Information Bureau", "Creutzfeldt Jakob"]}, {"docID": "20040126-1_68", "docDate": "Jan 27 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Engel's AngleWould you leave a loaded gun lying unattended around your yard, where anyone could have access to it?No. That would be stupid.Would you walk around town with an uncased, loaded gun?No. That would also be stupid, not to mention illegal.But hey, at least a gun wouldn't jump out of your backyard on its own will to shoot at those passing by.

For some reason, they crossed the border between species, and they infected humans. Mad cow disease traveled in the opposite direction. It crossed from humans to animals and back again. Mad cow disease was originally caused by human cannibalism. A small tribe in New Zealand ate their dead relatives as a sign of love and respect for them. They ate everything, including the brains, where the virus multiplied. Somehow, the virus crossed to animals.Because of man's greed for profit, ranchers rendered dead animals to feed to the grass-eating sheep. The extra protein made them grow faster and fatter. Thus, the virus of the disease was transferred to them. The same thing happened to cattle. In feed lots where cattle from the ranches were fattened, they were fed protein from corn, soybeans-mixed with rendered dead animals. (Rendering is a process by which animals are boiled in huge vats until the fat melts and the tissues break down. The resulting brew is then dried and mixed with animal feed.)The virus punches holes in the brains of the animals so that they stagger about like crazy until they fall and die, hence the term \"mad cow\" disease.Ebola used to be confined to monkeys. Primitive African tribes, who hunted wild animals for food, including monkeys, got the disease from them. Ebola is a horrible disease. The victim bleeds and rots from the inside-literally.

A group of conservationists wondered if the culprit might be a pesticide sprayed into the air to wipe out mosquitoes. The explanation quickly came from an unlikely source in Wisconsin.For several years, Warren Porter, a professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has been working with faculty and staff across campus to develop a computer model that could predict how animals, living on a real landscape anywhere on Earth, would respond to specific changes in the environment. The model could answer questions, such as how warmer temperatures would alter the activity patterns of squirrels in southern California or how removing the forest canopy in Yellowstone National Park would affect the elk that took cover under it during winter.\"If we fail to answer questions like these, we will continue to lose species - and their genomes, the biological libraries that have accumulated information for billions of years - from this planet,\" says Porter.But many of the models that had been designed to address ecological concerns, he adds, were inadequate: They didn't take into account the complexity of factors involved in the interaction between animals and their environment. To achieve a more sufficient model, Porter needed to integrate animal morphology, physiology and behavior with features of the climate, topography and vegetation of a particular area. \"Models are always an approximation to reality,\" he explains. \"You design them to ask specific questions. As the questions become more complex, the models become more complex. As computers have gained more power, we have been able to continue to add complexity and to solve very difficult problems.\"At the heart of Porter's integrated model is an understanding of energy transfer between animals and their surroundings. For instance, the animal's physical properties - body size, fur thickness, body temperature and breathing rate - help determine how much energy it needs to survive. The animal's behavioral patterns, such as how often it reproduces or how active it is, also are important factors. To apply this information in a real context, scientists must also determine how much energy is available based on environmental factors, including rainfall, temperature, vegetation, topography, sun exposure and time of day or year. The model, which incorporates remote satellite sensing and large-scale global climate models, can determine this.Because Porter's model integrates all this information on animal physiology and behavior and climate conditions in a predictive model, the scientist says, \"it can help us understand what the critical processes are that affect life processes on earth and how specific changes in environmental conditions may modify or even terminate those life processes.\"", "date": ["sun", "winter", "sun."], "place": ["Florida", "Wisconsin", "Yellowstone National Park", "southern California"], "person": "Warren Porter", "organization": "University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, {"docID": "20040126-4_15", "docDate": "Jan 29 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "On Aug. 6, 2003, at Paa-Ko subdivision in Sandia Park, citizens got a vivid example of what happens to a human-habituated bear under current state policy, i.e. \"A fed bear is a dead bear\" and \"three strikes and you're out.\" Thus a friendly, 2-year-old birdfeeder bear was shot dead by New Mexico Game and Fish (NMGF) officers in front of horrified BearWatch stewards, residents of Paa-Ko.

Early settlers came into the area with horses or oxen, some of which pulled wagons over the difficult terrain. Dogs came too, alerting settlers to strangers, sometimes accompanying hunters. The earliest concern about animals appears in the minutes of the towns where laws were passed concerning pigs: Were they to be free boarders or would they be contained? Free boarding pigs were, of course, easier for the owner as the animals rooted around for food themselves, feasting on fallen nuts, roots and other edibles. Free ranging pigs, however, could also pose a threat to neighboring garden patches and sometimes to small children. In the Village of Ithaca, pigs were to be contained, although cows roamed the streets well into the 1820s. In the Town of Ulysses, pigs were allowed to roam and householders fenced garden plots to keep the destructive animals out. Care of animals was generally left up to the owners until the 1880s, when the Society for the Prevention of Crime, led by Professor Jones and Director Marsh, began a campaign to \"clean up\" Ithaca. Their concern included wayward youth, irresponsible fathers, young girls who walked along Aurora Street, and the treatment of animals. The SPC provided the spark that led to what we now know as the SPCA -- the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. An important aspect of animal care was animal training. We wanted the animals that lived with us, especially dogs, to behave well, and not to disturb or annoy our neighbors. Few people in the 20th century kept cows or pigs in the city, but many had dogs and their behavior became a concern. People didn't want dogs leaping out and frightening children or visitors.

With the federal government controlling the investigation and Congress monopolizing the debate over what so-called \"downer\" cows can be used for after they are slaughtered, the state Legislature seems resigned to take only baby steps. \"We're going to have to take some sort of lead from the federal government,\" said state Rep.

The proposals are somewhat modest, though not without value, lawmakers say. Two of them - dealing with quarantines and animal identification - were in the works long before the mad cow discovery.The greatest debate is likely to be reserved for what limitations, if any, lawmakers put on the use of downer cows. Bills introduced in the Legislature would ban only the sale and transport, except to deliver the animals to a veterinarian.

There are many tactical approaches that can be used to pursue similar goals. These axioms are in evidence in a flap that's developed between The HSUS and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in our separate dealings with The Iams Company?the pet food company that is co-sponsoring Pet Fest America in six cities across the United States. PETA believes The HSUS should not co-sponsor an event with Iams because a PETA investigation turned up troubling information about the treatment of dogs at a contract research facility doing work for Iams. The story broke on March 25, 2003, with the posting of graphic images, including images of cats who were not included in the Iams-sponsored study. The HSUS, of course, strongly agrees that no animals should be subjected to de-barking, invasive surgery, forced feeding, or lack of socialization simply for nutrition studies. The HSUS looked into the matter, after PETA brought the issues to light, and asked Iams what corrective actions it would take. Iams was already in the process of investigating the circumstances; almost immediately, it terminated the project at the laboratory where PETA's investigation occurred. The company removed its 19 dogs back to its own facility and then adopted them out to employees. Iams conducted inspections of all remaining study sites, terminating a number of studies, and reasserted the importance of the company's humane care policies at the remainder. The HSUS has neither endorsed the past actions of Iams, nor the company's current practices. We are, however, working with the company to see that any animals under its care are properly treated. What's more, we are demanding that the company move away from laboratory tests that might cause harm to the dogs and cats, and put their resources into clinical studies that result in no harm. In short, The HSUS has chosen a different tactical approach than PETA. We have chosen the course of discussion and co-operation rather than confrontation. We did not invent this approach. It is similar to one first developed by Henry Spira, an animal activist highly regarded for his successful tactics, and we believe it can work in many circumstances.", "date": "March 25, 2003", "place": ["United States", "America"], "person": ["Henry Spira", "Iams"], "organization": ["HSUS", "PETA"]}, {"docID": "20040126_9", "docDate": "Jan 26 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Bill's supporteSpectators at illegal dog- and cockfights would be subject to criminal penalties under a bill proposed by Del.

Arranging cockfights, breeding fighting birds or fitting fighting birds with enhancements -- knifelike implements called gaffs or slashers or other names -- also would be felonies subject to the three-year, $5,000 penalty. In addition, cockfighting is a threat to agriculture, Boutin said, because a virus associated with fighting known as \"Exotic Newcastle Disease\" could spread to commercial poultry.

New legislation would make it an imprisonable offence tointimidate scientists involved in animal research, and prevent large groupsgathering outside laboratories. A national police unit dedicated to tacklinganimal terrorism could be set up.The decision follows last week's announcement that Cambridge University hasabandoned construction of its proposed Primate Research Centre. Thelaboratory, where scientists would have carried out research on Parkinson's,Alzheimer's and other brain diseases, was ditched because of the costs ofprotecting buildings and staff from people protesting about the use ofprimates in experiments had begun to spiral out of control. The laboratory'sprice tag had already risen from \u00a324 million to \u00a332m and was expected toincrease even more as security estimates soared.Now talks are going on between research chiefs and government officials in aattempt to find alternative ways of supporting research on apes, which havebrains similar to humans and are considered vital for developing newtreatments for neurological disorders. At the same time the Home Office ispreparing a specific set of laws to protect UK scientists from attacks.Most senior scientists and drug company officials believe only a few dozenhardcore activists are responsible for these attacks. 'Britain has the bestneuroscience in the world but a handful of activists are driving awaycompanies that want to exploit that expertise. And don't forget,pharmaceuticals made a &pond;3 billion contribution to our balance of tradelast year,' said Trevor Jones, head of the Association of the BritishPharmaceutical Industry.Tactics used by activists include throwing rape alarms on the roofs of thehomes of lab staff, planting burning crosses in gardens, sending bombthreats to schools of employees' children, pouring acid on cars, smashinghomes and daubing on walls claims that staff are rapists and paedophiles.'Nobody wants to disrupt the right to peaceful protest but this is beyondwhat any civilised society should be expected to tolerate,' Jones said. 'Thelaw is not strong enough.'Between November 1999 and September 2002 an estimated 450 demonstrations,many of them violent, took place outside Huntingdon Life SciencesLaboratory, the Cambridge animal research centre that has become a focus forattacks. There were arrests on only 28 occasions.'Until scientists can carry out a limited number of controlled experimentson animals, including primates, we are not going to find cures forAlzheimer's, Parkinson's and other diseases,' said Aisling Burnand, chiefexecutive of the Bioindustry Association.Last year a wave of attacks were directed against UK-based Japanesepharmaceutical companies including Yamanouchi, Esai and Daiichi. Executiveswere attacked, cars damaged, and homes ransacked. Only the inter vention ofScience Minister Lord Sainsbury, who flew to Japan to assure government andcompany officials that Britain was committed to protecting scientists,prevented firms from leaving the UK.Some changes to the law have since been introduced but, in the wake ofCambridge University's decision that it still cannot provide protection foranimal researchers in the city, drug companies are now demanding a clearsignal be sent by government to help the biotechnology industry.'Specific regulation is needed to tackle this,' said Mark Matfield,executive director of the Research Defence Society.The new legislation could make it an imprisonable offence to intimidate aperson because he or she is involved in animal research. Other ideas beforethe committee include 50-metre exclusion zones around research centres andtargeting extremists in the way the Football Disorder Act allows hooligansto be banned from matches merely because police officers have 'reasonablesuspicions' about them.Other measures would be directed at those who try to intimidate financialbackers of laboratories and research centres. The Government had to step into provide insurance for Huntingdon Life Sciences after its insurers, Marsh& McLellan, backed out after waves of intimidation. At one stage activistsdisrupted performances by the English National Ballet because Marsh &McLellan's UK chairman, Hamish Ritchie, was a member of its board.Some scientists had already warned about the abandoned primate centre.Professor Colin Blakemore, head of the Medical Research Council, a leadingUK physiologist and himself the tar get of vicious attacks by animalactivists, told The Observer he had always feared the centre would betargeted. 'We needed a primate research centre as much as we needed a mouseresearch centre or a hamster research centre. That is not how biologicalresearch works. Research on animals should continue to be integrated intoindividual science departments.The logic of a centre dedicated to only onetype of animal was always suspect and it was risky to put it in an isolatedpart of Cambridge where it could be portrayed by activists as a windowlesstemple of animal torture.'Jan Creamer, chief executive of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, said:'We don't believe the claim by Cambridge University that they have withdrawntheir plans for security reasons. During the public inquiry they convincedthe inspector that security was not an issue that would prevent theCambridge primate lab from being built. Now, a year later, they have changedtheir minds.'In addition, ministers are understood to be seriously considering movingpart of the abandoned laboratory's work to the government's top-secretchemical weapons establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire, a move that willinfuriate opponents who argue it allow primate experiments to be carried intotal secrecy.Officials at Porton Down have already begun breeding primates there. One ofits key partners was the University of Cambridge.Internal government documents also indicate production of primates hasincreased at Porton Down's Defence Science & Technology Division forapparent use at the Cambridge centre. Findings by the animal welfareadvisory committee reveal that while hopes of building the Cambridge siteremained strong, Porton was 'increasing macaque production in theexpectation of increased future experimental demand'.The new primate breeding facility offers 'state-of-the-art accommodation'and is designed to house 250 macaques with around 100 of these earmarked forexperiments a year. 'Their quarters are fine. I would not necessarily wantto live in them myself, but as far as they go I think we have very highstandards,' said Defence Minister Lewis Moonie in a parliamentary answer.However, the idea of carrying out primate experiments for civil researchaimed at creating life-saving drugs is vigoursly opposed by researchers suchas Blakemore.

Your opinion is that Catholics -- and all other Christians -- should be vegetarians? Jesus' message is about love and compassion, but there is nothing loving or compassionate at factory farms and slaughterhouses, where billions of animals endure miserable lives and die violent deaths. Jesus mandates kindness and mercy for all God's creatures. He'd be appalled by the suffering that we inflict on animals today to indulge our acquired taste for their flesh. Catholics, and all Christians, have a choice. When we sit down to eat, we can add to the violence, misery and death in the world, or we can respect God's creatures with a vegetarian diet. I believe we're obligated to make choices that are as merciful as possible, and we can all do that at the dinner table with a vegetarian diet. There won?t be any factory farms and slaughterhouses in heaven. So, you think the God of Christians never wanted people to eat meat? The Garden of Eden, God's perfect world, was vegetarian (Gen. 1:29-30), and God called this nonexploitative relationship \"good\" (Gen. 1:31). After Eden there were many, many years of fallen humanity, when people held slaves, waged war, ate animals and committed various other violent acts. But the Old Testament prophets tell us that the final, peaceful Kingdom of God will be nonviolent and vegetarian; even \"the lion will lie down with the lamb,\" according to the prophet Isaiah.

The revelation willraisefurther questions about the validity of the controversialcondition Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) - firsttheorised in 1977 by paediatrician Professor Sir Roy Meadow- which suggests some parents harm their children to drawattention to themselves.Critics of MSBP, which has been discredited following aseries of court cases, fear it blinds social workers,lawyers and judges to other explanations for apparent childabuse, such as the side effects of drugs or the symptonsassociated with a number of illnesses.  The conference, atSydney University in Australia, aims to debunk MSBPand isset to attract worldwide attention. It will hear calls forafull investigation into cisapride, which was withdrawn inthe US and the UK three years ago after it was linked to136deaths worldwide, including those of two British children.'Given the amount of cases where cisapride has played asignificant part in the child's treatment and the child'sparents have been diagnosed as having MSBP, it isimperativethe Government launches an investigation into this drug,'said Penny Mellor an anti-MSBP campaigner.The Government said last month that it is to investigatemore than 250 criminal cases in which a parent had beenconvicted of murdering a child. The decision was takenaftera series of overturned convictions.  Sally Clark was freedafter spending three years in jail for killing her twochildren. Trupti Patel was acquitted of smothering herthreebabies. Angela Cannings, jailed for killing her two sons,was released by the Court of Appeal last December.The Government is also planning to ask local authorities toexamine up to 5,000 cases in which children were taken fromtheir parents in the civil courts and in which MSBP mayhavebeen cited. Authorities in the US, Canada, Australia andNewZealand, are also under pressure to examine cases in whichparents were separated from their children following thediagnosis of MSBP.The first civil cases involving parents who claim they werewrongly separated from their children as a result of MSBP,are currently being prepared for appeal.  Meadow andanotherpaediatrician who has advanced the MSBP theory, ProfessorDavid Southall, are now the subjects of separate inquiriesby the General Medical Council. The Observer has alsolearntthat there are at least four other experts in the field ofMSBP whose work is now likely to be scrutinised by thehealth authorities.Since The Observer highlighted the allegation that MSBP wasresponsible for a series of miscarriages of justice lastweek, numerous other cases where the parents claim theyhavebeen wrongly separated from their child have come to light.In one case in Hampshire, a mother accused of MSBP wasseparated from her two seriously ill twins but allowed tokeep her other two children. The twins were eventually putinto care and the mother was forced to give the other twochildren up for adoption. She subsequently emigrated to NewZealand where she alleges British social services contactedcounterparts there with the result that two other childrenshe had with another partner ended up being taken intocare.Her case is one of the first that is expected to beappealedthis year.Janssen Pharmaceutica, makers of cisapride, declined tocomment.VIN Note:  Janssen were also involved in the Propulsid atrocities (1998) in which a drug known to kill children was deliberately marketed via child health organisations.", "date": ["1977", "1998", "last December", "last month", "last week", "this week", "this year", "three years ago"], "place": ["Australia", "Canada", "Hampshire", "MSBP", "New Zealand", "UK", "US"], "person": ["Angela Cannings", "David Southall", "Penny Mellor", "Roy Meadow", "Sally Clark"], "organization": ["Court of Appeal", "General Medical Council", "Sydney University", "VIN", "paediatrician"]}, {"docID": "20040202_73", "docDate": "Feb 2 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "While visiting Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, European Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin is attending today an expert seminar on the trends affecting agriculture and food production.

For some reason, they crossed the border between species, and infected humans in Asia, particularly. But the mad cow disease that affected Americas traveled in the opposite direction. It crossed from humans to animals and back again. Mad cow disease was originally caused by human cannibalism. A small tribe in New Zealand ate their dead relatives as a sign of love and respect for them. They ate everything, including the brains, where the virus multiplied. Somehow, the virus crossed to animals. Because of man's greed for profit, ranchers rendered dead animals to feed the grass-eating sheep. The extra protein made them grow faster and fatter. Thus, the virus of the disease was transferred to them. The same thing happened to cattle. In feed lots where cattle from the ranches were fattened, they were fed protein from corn, soybeans -- mixed with rendered dead animals. Rendering is a process by which animals are boiled in huge vats until the fat melts and the tissues break down. The resulting brew is then dried and mixed with animal feed. The virus punches holes in the brains of the animals so that they stagger about crazy until they fall and die, hence the term \"mad cow\" disease. Ebola used to be confined to monkeys. Primitive African tribes, who hunted wild animals for food, including monkeys, got the disease from them. Ebola is a horrible disease. The victim bleeds and rots from inside -- literally. Blood oozes out of every orifice in the body. This oozing is very contagious.

At the Fort Worth Zoo, animals perform their mating rituals free of the romanticism and bad poetry of Valentine's Day. The often-mysterious whoopee-making activities of the 435 species at the zoo offer a fascinating study of behavior. But the subject is more than a curiosity for the keepers and curators, who use breeding to maintain the captive population, and in some cases, to act as a hedge against extinction. And while old-fashioned animal instinct is a powerful thing, it doesn't always lead to a lucky evening. Sometimes the keepers must intervene to help nature run its course. In some areas of the zoo, however, unchecked randiness has led to a different kind of intervention. Reproduction is \"one of the most interesting parts of biology,\" said Robert Wiese, the zoo's director of animal collections. The zoo, along with most other major U.S. zoos, maintains a complex set of genealogical records on its animals, particularly on its 39 endangered or threatened species. It is Wiese's job to cull through the stud books to find mates for animals from jaguars and mountain bongos to rhinoceroses and elephants. He tries to keep the gene pool as broad as possible by matching animals that are the most unrelated genetically. \"It's almost the opposite of domesticated animals,\" he said. \"Where they're trying to breed faster thoroughbreds or more milk production from cows, we try not to select for anything.\" But nature is anything but uniform in its approach to reproduction, and so the curators and keepers at the zoo must think creatively to satisfy each animal.

The top half turned black as if it had been burnt, then it crumpled like paper. I think (and hope) that once it turns black, there's no feeling in it. But once the ends of the ears actually fall off, it leaves a raw edge that has to start healing all over again. That, I suspect, must hurt.

Just hours before attending a New Years Eve fundraiser for TUSVM's Oncology department we learned of the plight of five research dogs with surgically broken legs. Prior to hearing the evening news, none of us had scrutinized the kinds of research our donations might be supporting. As supporters and patrons of a school considered an ethical leader in the humane treatment of animals, we had simply taken it for granted that our dollars were being spent on the research of naturally occurring disease and injury. After hearing the news we immediately began to reevaluate our previous misconception.     Although it was learned that the Oncology fundraiser had no apparent direct ties to the experiment in question, several attendees continued to express concern that their donation's might be diverted to animal research methods that they themselves might not agree with. Consequently, the research dogs' story prompted us to begin a discussion of our views on the subject of responsible animal research.     Whereas, we are not all scientists, together we possess extensive experience caring for a wide variety of animal species with varying degrees of good health, illness and injury. Accordingly, it doesn't take a scientific degree to know that it should be possible to measure the healing of canine bones through the same methods as are used with humans, or that rehabilitation possibilities do exist for two or three legged dogs \"bred specifically for research\" (\"Dogs now gone: Tufts destroys five research canines\"", "date": "Feb. 9", "place": ["Grafton", "Cape"], "person": "Eve", "organization": ["Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine", "TUSVM"], "time": "evening"}, {"docID": "20040216-1_9", "docDate": "Feb 17 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "A mourning dove in flight is erratic.

If you are interested and you are DEFINITELY available on the dates to follow - no last-minute drop outs please - then email the dates you are able to help, to the following email address - oink@animal-lib.org.au These festivals usually only allow a certain number of helpers - usually two or three, so you should get in fast if you are really interested in being there to help out. The first stall is at the 'Two Tribes' Festival at the Sydney Showgrounds on Saturday the 6th March. Starting time is unknown as yet. Apparently this is an all-night festival so you will have to be prepared to go all night! These festivals are usually very exhausting as you are on the go all the time (make sure you bring a chair) talking to people, selling goods, getting people to sign petitions, and making sure the Animal Liberation stall is presentable and helpful. The second stall coming up is called 'Shoreshocked', it's on Saturday, March the 27th at St Leonards Park. Starting time is unknown as yet. This will be an all-day festival and will be just as exhausting as the all nighter above. You usually start early and finish very late. As mentioned above, if you are definitely available and willing to spend a whole day/night at an Animal Lib stall helping to spread the word of what we do, along with raising some much needed money.

They should then be killed by splitting, or spiking, the brain just before boiling.RSPCA research scientist Caleb Gardner said recent studies had revealed that even crustaceans feel pain.The guidelines were formulated by a National Scientific Advisory Panel and experts in marine zoology.RSPCA Australia President Hugh Wirth said it was recognised that fish, lobsters and crabs could feel pain.\"If you chuck a live crustacean into a boiling pot of water, they feel that and you are killing them cruelly,\" he said. However, that question is still hotly debated by scientists, with some saying crustaceans and fish do not possess the brain and nerve structures to feel pain in any form recognisable to humans.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -BIRD FLU TOLL RISES TO 22 From correspondents in Bangkok THE toll in Asia's bird flu crisis rose to 22 today with Vietnam and Thailand each announcing the death of a young boy, as several nations battled new outbreaks of the deadly virus.A Thai health ministry spokeswoman said that tests showed a four-year-old boy from north-eastern Khon Kaen province who died on February 3 was the seventh person in the kingdom to be killed by the virus. And in Vietnam a doctor in Lam Dong province said a three-year-old boy who died early today had tested positive for the deadly H5N1 virus. The countries are the only ones to have confirmed human infections of the virus, which has been reported in poultry in eight other Asian nations. However, health authorities in Indonesia have launched an investigation into whether a 55-year-old man who died in hospital on Monday had eaten chicken infected with bird flu. As more cases broke out in Thailand, China and Japan this week, the United Nations warned Asia's bird flu crisis was far from over and that nations should not set timelines to declare themselves free of the virus. Japan's plans to announce this week that its bird flu woes were over were dashed yesterday when it confirmed a second outbreak, just before China reported two new confirmed cases in central Hunan province. The discovery prompted Japanese officials today to begin inspecting farms housing some 6.8 million birds near the southwestern prefecture where bird flu was detected in bantams raised as pets. A ban on shipment of poultry and eggs within a 30-kilometre radius of the infected site was also imposed, officials said. Thailand had also been on the brink of declaring its crisis over and beginning to rebuild its devastated $US1.2 billion ($1.51 billion) poultry export business before announcing on Monday that bird flu had re-emerged in poultry in nine provinces. Thai officials have warned they expect more cases to be confirmed when the results of the latest round of testing are announced on Friday - after the close of the stock market which has been buffeted by the unfolding crisis. Deputy agriculture minister Newin Chidchob said revelations that bird flu had re-emerged in 14 zones were gleaned from 2000 samples taken nationwide, and that the results of another 8000 samples would bring more bad news. Newin blamed the new outbreaks on breeders of fighting cocks, whom he said fled infected regions with their valuable birds instead of slaughtering them. The World Health Organisation warned last week that Thailand risked triggering a second outbreak of bird flu by lifting quarantine zones too hastily. A cull of more than 80 million chickens has so far failed to contain the outbreak which has hit Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos and South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, with weaker strains in Taiwan and Pakistan. Singapore today carried out a practice cull of 5000 chickens at a privately owned farm which authorities said showed the city-state was prepared to deal with any outbreak of bird flu. The chickens - healthy hens which can no longer lay eggs - were stuffed in heavy-duty bags and suffocated with carbon dioxide before being disposed of in an incinerator. The United Arab Emirates meanwhile today became the latest of a host of countries to ban the import of live poultry and birds from China due to concerns over bird flu. The UAE, which acts as regional trade hub for goods flowing from Asia to the rest of the Middle East and Europe, has already slapped a similar ban on live birds and eggs from Cambodia and Laos.

These reports include chickens often buried alive in mass graves in countries across Asia; in South Korea and Vietnam, tens of thousands have been beaten with iron bars or sticks before being buried; chickens in China have been set on fire whilst still alive and, in Taiwan, chickens have been poisoned and then buried. Millions of poultry have already been handled and slaughtered with little regard for their welfare. The international bodies responsible for handling this outbreak, FAO (UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation), OIE (World Animal Health Organisation) and WHO (World Health Organisation), have so far neglected to address the issue of animal welfare. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\"CHESTNUTS IN THE MIST\"A CHESTNUT HARVEST SMORGASBORD featuring chestnuts collected at Mt Wilson, in the beautiful Blue Mountains!Emphasis will be on locally-grown and organically-grown wherever possible.

An Italian team headed by Salvatore Monaco of the GB Rossi Polyclinic in Verona, Italy found the new prion variant in the brains of two of eight Italian cows that tested positive for BSE. The two cows' brains were not poked with holes as in typical BSE cases, however. The scientists found instead an accumulation of amyloid plaques and that different parts of the brain were affected. The new prion is similar to the one found \"in many sporadic cases of the human disease (CJD),\" according to the study's news release.

The attorney general's office wasn't sure of the correct spelling on Thursday.In any case, Reed said \"chuting\" is done not to hide anything but to speed shipment of cattle after a sale.Here's how the process works.When cattle are brought to a sale barn, a state brand inspector makes a record of each animal, its brand and its owner.After the sale, a brand inspector fills out a market clearance form listing each animal, its buyer and its brand. That practice should be followed whenever cattle are sold to a feedlot, Reed said.But state officials said inspectors often cut corners on the market clearance form when the cattle sold are going right to a slaughterhouse. Loads of cattle sold for slaughter are usually from many different herds and carry many different brands.Writing down each slaughter cow's brand would add hours to the shipping process, Reed said.\"They want to get those cows out of those pens, get them on trucks and get them to slaughter.\"So inspectors write down the exact number of cows in the shipment but record only a sampling of the brands.\"Nobody is ever going to look at those brand papers again,\" Reed said. \"They're going east to a slaughter plant.\"Reed said the \"chuting\" practice was in use when he became a brand inspector in South Dakota in 1960 and has been widespread and accepted since.However, the attorney general's report insisted that \"chuting\" results in inaccurate or incomplete market clearances to cattle buyers. The practice makes it difficult and, in some cases, impossible to track title for individual cattle, the report said.Reed said if there is any question of ownership, the brand record for each cow is still on file at the sale barn.Reed said that before Derr's investigation, he thought chuting was legal. He still isn't convinced it is illegal but has ordered all inspectors to stop the practice.Reed also disputed other allegations in the report and in statements by state officials:n Long said the inspection system failed to discover at least half a dozen instances of cattle theft.Reed said that charge originated from an incident at the Philip Livestock Auction in which seven or eight stolen cattle were sold and later discovered in Montana.At the time, investigator Derr said he was troubled that stolen cattle with a registered brand and no proof of ownership could be sold within the West River Ownership Inspection Area.But Reed said the sale barn and inspectors there followed proper procedure, requiring the seller to sign an affidavit showing where he had bought the cattle. That paper trail helped trace the cattle and prosecute the thief, Reed said.Reed said he didn't know of other thefts the state report mentioned.n The report said some brand inspectors illegally kept money from \"local\" inspections, those done at ranch sales. \"That is bogus,\" Reed said. He said money from local inspections comes into his office.

Many survived by drinking melted snow that leaked through the trailer's roof and by eating one another. Three of the rescued cats later died from diseases associated with malnutrition. Weeks later, police discovered an unlicensed dog-breeding facility operated by Peplin-Sobelman. There, authorities found 155 dogs and seized 30 animals suffering from ailments often associated with neglect.

Eating soy, it now appears, is one of the simplest things we can do to boost our health. Once revered as a sacred crop in China, soybeans are one of the richest plant sources of protein. In fact, the World Health Organization considers it on par with meat and dairy proteins. But not only is this low-fat dietary protein great news for vegetarians or dieters, a growing body of research indicates that soy may help prevent many chronic diseases. Many of its therapeutic benefits are believed to come from its vast stores of isoflavones. These bioactive plant chemicals function like weak estrogen--a female hormone necessary for normal growth and development--by adjusting the hormone's effects when levels are too high or low.To get the most out of soy, health experts suggest eating whole foods like tofu, soymilk and tempeh because they contain higher levels of isoflavones than processed foods or supplements. Fortunately, there are now a variety of soy and tofu products that are both convenient and tasty.

But given the realities of beak and talon, I understand. A fleeting shadow crosses the yard and, in unison, all the birds freeze or flee. If I detect the panic, I scan the nearby trees for the hunter. Bird-eating hawks can wreak havoc at backyard feeding stations. That's what these hawks do -- they eat birds. There's nothing you can do to get rid of the hawks, but you can make sure your feeding area is relatively safe. Hang feeders within 10 feet of trees or shrubs, which provide escape cover for smaller birds. Try to appreciate the drama of predator and prey. I tell myself I'm lucky when a hawk visits my backyard. It's not often I get a close look at such a normally secretive bird. And it's rarer still to witness the matching of predator and prey. So I sit back and savor the drama. After all, the hawk doesn't always win. In fact, it usually loses. Typically, fewer than half of a hawk's strikes are successful. I feel fortunate to have observed several successful attacks. Once, a group of cub scouts came to my house for a bird banding demonstration. I had trapped a few goldfinches in advance and after banding them, I let the boys take turns holding and releasing the birds. All but the last flew uneventfully into the hedge that surrounded the yard.

It may be no bigger than a poppy seed, but some neuroscientists think the fruit fly's brain contains the rudiments of consciousness. Douglas Fox peers through this unlikely window on the human mind                    A FRUIT fly hovers in mid-air. Its bulbous eyes capture a panoramic view of the world, but it ignores most of what it sees. Instead, it is captivated by one small thing: a bright green stripe that just zipped by. It's worth a closer look, worth landing on. The fly chases after it.      Or so it thinks. The fly is actually in a laboratory and suspended on a wire inside a miniature flight simulator. Surrounding the fly is a cylindrical LED screen, and travelling around that screen is a vertical stripe of green light. Each time the stripe comes into view, the fly tries to steer towards it. Sensors count the fly's wing beats, measure its orientation, and control the motion of the stripe accordingly. If the fly steers hard enough, it can halt the stripe and hold it steady in its view.      It's a neat gizmo, but watching it work I discover there's more to it than that. Inserted in the fly's brain is an electrode, and buzzing through that electrode, scrolling across a computer screen, are some curious brainwaves. Whenever the fly steers towards the stripe, these saw-tooth waves grow taller, and when the fix is lost, they shrink.      Ralph Greenspan, the researcher showing me this experiment, thinks these little waves are a very big deal. \"The fly thinks that something important is happening to it,\" he says. \"That stripe is what the fly considers to be a significant stimulus from its environment.\" In other words, the fly is paying attention.      That might not sound too impressive. Even a fruit fly needs to be able to focus on important stimuli - how else would it find food or avoid danger? But there's more to it than that.

Boris was friendly and clearly well-cared for. Believing he just got out by mistake, once Marv was caught, we let him go. Now we know that was a mistake.      But before I get too far into Boris' story, be assured that Marv is well and awaiting adoption at the Milford Animal Shelter. He's a little more social now and is slowly getting used to both cats and humans.      But, back to Boris. Presto Rubel, a former Winthrop Street resident who has since moved out of town, said she posted the notices after learning that Boris' owner, Bob Harter, had died. Harter, who owned the Winthrop Street home where Rubel and her husband lived, owned five cats, but Boris, she said, \"was clearly his favorite.\"      Rubel describes Harter as \"a well-traveled person, with a delightful sense of humor.\" And, she said, \"he loved cats.\"      But unknown to Rubel, Harter died Oct. 15 of a massive heart attack and his beloved cats were cared for by a tenant. Rubel said she learned only two weeks ago of Harter's death when the tenant called to say she was moving and needed someone to care for the other cats.

Typically, these are table scraps and garbage. Fatty foods are the worst. The disease is often seen around the holidays or family gatherings in which pets are fed leftovers.

A 1983?1984 H5N2 virus epidemic (a more potent and lethal strain of the avian influenza) in the US resulted in the destruction of more than 17 million birds (at a cost of nearly $65 million). To me it seems like such a waste. It's disgusting that \"industry\" has become this powerful and that profits far outweigh the concerns of keeping animals healthy, thus keeping the public healthy. But I suppose the large amounts of antibiotics (more than 70% of all the antibiotics used in the US are for farm animals) that are fed or injected into factory farm animals as part of their daily routine of eating while constantly caged (compensation for over-crowded and unsanitary conditions conducive to infections) are the \"preventative measures\" that we keep hearing about whenever an infectious outbreak occurs.", "date": ["February 23rd", "last spring", "1984", "1983"], "money": ["$65 million", "$65 million"], "place": ["Foster", "RI", "Rhode Island", "US"], "organization": ["Department of Environmental Management", "U.S. Department of Agriculture"]}, {"docID": "20040223-3_33", "docDate": "Feb 28 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Lucy Spelman, director of the 114-year old National Zoo in Washington, D.C., announced plans to retire Wednesday, the same day a highly critical, yearlong independent review by the National Academy of Sciences was released.

Regardless of the method used to count them, one trend shows up time after time - sport hunters in America are a vanishing breed.

Heberlein, an authority on the demographics of sport hunting, that, \"If these trends continue, hunting as we know it will not exist by 2050.\" The reasons are obvious - loss of habitat for wildlife because of both urbanization and increasingly destructive land management practices, the changing demographics of our population, changing lifestyles in our society, and a growing propaganda campaign about killing animals for pleasure. If the reasons for the decline of sport hunting are so obvious, the most practical approach to reversing it is just as obvious.

Manure from 1,200 cows covers the concrete floors in those areas.Fortunately, Niessen hands out plastic, throw-away boots to his unprepared guests. That protects their shoes and protects his cows from anything harmful the shoes might transport into the barn.Cable-operated automatic floor scrapers slowly push squishy cow dung into drain trenches that flow into a 5-million-gallon storage lagoon outdoors.\"This is the swimming pool,\" Niessen jokes.His cows discharge enough manure in a year to fill 750 above-ground swimming pools, each 52 inches deep and 24 feet around.Niessen is one of dozens of European dairy farmers - mostly Dutch - who have moved to Indiana, Michigan and Ohio since the late 1990s, in part because there is an excess of manure in The Netherlands.Together, the immigrants have started 11 concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in Indiana housing 12,625 dairy cows.That represents more than eight percent of Indiana's dairy cow population.Vreba-Hoff Dairy Development, Wauseon, Ohio, is steering the European farmers to the three states.The company has developed three dozen dairy CAFOs for the newcomers and has at least 10 more in various stages of development. One of them is Dutch farmer Tony Goltstein's proposed Union-Go Dairy in Randolph County.How many more will come?\"I think we're in the middle of it at this point,\" said Vreba-Hoff's Cecilia Conway, a U.S. citizen whose parents came to America from The Netherlands in 1960. \"There's still a lot of interest.\"The public is making a stink over the new Dutch dairies in all three states because of their size, odors, manure spills, construction violations and other concerns.After neighbors complained that Niessen's dairy stunk up their laundry when hung out to dry, the Henry County Planning Commission denied his petition to expand his herd from 1,200 to 1,900. Niessen hired a lawyer who sued the planning commission and the neighbors. The case is pending.An organization called Environmentally Concerned Citizens of Randolph County formed last year to stop what it calls Goltstein's proposed \"factory farm,\" which would house 1,650 cows.

Strays flank the gilded portals to fancy boutiques like furry, four-legged doormen with a naked hankering for table scraps. In an unfortunate, widely publicized incident last summer, one stray bit a Ukrainian archery coach who was in Athens for Olympic test events and out for a run. The wound was not serious, except to the scruffy image of Athens and its environs, whose caretakers are now trying, in a manner that might well be described as dogged, to tame the situation. Just a few months ago the national government enacted legislation meant to reduce the stray population by holding Greeks more accountable, with toughened pet registration requirements and stiff fines for abandoning their pets to the streets. People here apparently do that with some regularity, which city officials describe as the principal source of the problem. Athens, for its part, is funneling about $2 million this year into new animal shelters, more animal control officers and a major sterilization project. Stray by randy stray, dogs are being rounded up, neutered and then -- if they are not adopted in two weeks -- set free to roam anew, but in a less reproductive fashion.

Dr Julian Toms, based in Portree on Skye, has been prompted into collecting details of collisions after many of his patients and colleagues were involved in deer-related accidents. He is to pass his findings to his MSP and an Executive-backed research programme investigating deer collisions, which are seen as a significant and growing problem. It is estimated between 15,000 and 20,000 deer-related accidents occur in Scotland every year - about a quarter of the UK total - while at least nine people have died and ten been seriously injured in Scotland between 1996 and 2000. It is thought the accidents cost about \u00a35 million a year, with another \u00a31 million estimated in damage to vehicles. However, the current figures are only the tip of the iceberg, as accurate information on the scale of the problem, its geographical distribution, and accident black-spots is still lacking. Dr Toms said that since starting his study of the accident toll two weeks ago, he has been sent details of 11 road accidents involving deer which occurred in the last year, and is aware of another six collisions. Although none resulted in serious injury, the cost of damage to cars has ranged from \u00a3200 to \u00a32,500. The most common accident hot spots are the A87 road, near the Cluanie Inn between Invermoriston and Kyle, and around Glenshiel in Wester Ross as well as between Broadford and Kyleakin in Skye. \"I had an accident myself three weeks ago at Glenshiel when I hit a red deer hind. \"My car is still being repaired at a cost of several thousand pounds. This was a Land Rover and had it been a smaller vehicle the hind may have come through the windscreen. \"I work in a partnership of six doctors and now three of us have hit deer in the last 18 months. \"I have a letter from a woman who was involved in an accident and who is now very afraid of driving on this road, so it's affecting people quite badly and making them hesitant about driving, particularly at night and in the winter.\" Dr Toms said many similar accidents go unreported each year and is to suggest that a system is introduced making reporting to police compulsory.He added: \"A member of staff at the local hospital was in an accident when the deer came through the windscreen and right into the vehicle. An animal that weight and size could cause major injuries. \"The other problem is that people try to avoid deer on the road and there is a risk of hitting another vehicle.\" Dr Toms's action has been welcomed by Professor Rory Putman, who is collecting information on deer accidents in Scotland as part of a two-year UK-wide project to develop a national register and highlight the scale of the problem and the worst affected areas. Prof Putman said researchers are now getting more complete details of accidents involving human injuries from all police forces, as well as information from insurance companies for claims to vehicles, from councils who have to remove deer carcasses, trunk road agencies and the Forestry Commission, stalkers, the Scottish Society for the Protection of Animals and members of the public. He said: \"The information from people like Dr Toms will help us get more objective estimates of the number of incidents arising in Scotland and identify the hot spots.\" Ongoing research may help efforts towards preventative measures.

I need some advise from you as to how you would go about getting the word out to the civilized world about what is going on in Romania.  The govt. has no compassion for these animals, and has massive slaughter campaigns whereby they send out killing squads to poison, club, or kick the dogs to death.  This is not the solution to the problem, obviously, or these dogs would not keep coming back and causing this over-population crisis.  Often when the word gets out about the horrible condition of the strays, the Romanian govt. is embarrassed and has a slaughter campaign to clean up the dogs and pretend that they have solved the problem \"humanely\" (out of sight, out of mind, you know?).  In most cities, the govt. taxes the citizens and says it is spaying/neutering dogs with the $, but we have checked these dogs and found that they are in tact.  The authorities just keep the $, and the people are frustrated with having to pay the taxes and angry with the dogs, and so the neglect and abuse is rampant.  I have been told that Romania has the highest stray dog population of any country in the world, and I believe this to be the case.    Our shelter has a spay/neuter release program, and we have over 10,000 dogs in our city alone to care for.  I am being asked for help throughout Romania, but have decided I can get the most done by focussing on one successful program at a time.  With our program, we only keep dogs incapable of street life at our shelter for life care, (crippled, blind, etc.).  It is a sanctuary for dogs - a clean, spacious and loving environment.  We have parasite medications that we use to keep them happy and healthy, and feed the best food we can find - which is another problem - and we want to start making our own healthy dry dog food at a reasonable price for us and the people of Romania.

These days we've got legislators on opposite sides of the philosophical divide trying to dictate that: ? The best use of all Alaska big-game animals should be food. ? The Board of Game should be restructured to give a larger say to \"nonconsumptive\" wildlife users, i.e. animal lovers. Has the entire process been taken over by extremists on opposite ends of the debate who share only one thing, a fundamental lack of understanding about Arctic and subarctic ecosystems? One group wants a moose behind every willow bush. The other wants wolves so plentiful as to make wolf viewing an easy and marketable activity. Neither is feasible, let alone realistic. Alaska is a far northern landscape. A short growing season restricts the diversity and productivity of plant life, limiting the number of herbivores it can support. The small number of prey species -- even counting Alaska's caribou herds, which look large because they cluster -- dictate that there will be food for only a limited number of predators. Man can manipulate this environment. Nonconsumptive users who think nature operates in some sort of sensible balance, are simply wrong. Look no further than Anchorage. The city is overrun with moose for one simple reason: It's a predator-free zone. Motor vehicles kill plenty of moose here every year, but they do not kill anywhere near as many as wild predators take. Still, you may have noticed you can't count on finding a moose in Anchorage anytime you want. Visiting tourist friends might drive around town for days and not spot a moose. It is worth noting that if we decided Anchorage moose should be consumed, we wouldn't feed many people. Unless we wanted to kill all 1,000 or so in one big bloodletting -- after which no one would ever see a moose in Anchorage again -- we might be able to remove 200 moose a year from this population. But cars already get more than 100. So the number of moose that hunters could shoot would be fewer than that. I'd like to shoot an Anchorage moose. I like moose meat, and the doggone critters are always getting up on my deck to eat our willows. It would be easy and convenient to dump a winter supply of meat right there outside the door. It's an Alaska village resident's fantasy. But I'm not sure it's the highest and best use of Anchorage's moose. I actually think it might be better if instead of using Anchorage moose to feed people -- the roadkills go to charity -- we started using Anchorage moose to feed wolves. I'm truly sympathetic with all those nonconsumptive users who want to see a wolf. That's tough to do in Alaska, and we could make it easier. We could create wolf-viewing areas by picking a place to dump the carcasses of moose killed on Anchorage roads or by wildlife officials.

A report into the number of raptors, compiled by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), found numbers rising - despite 19th-century practices to eliminate predators from country estates still being \"firmly entrenched amongst a proportion of Scotland's 21st-century land managers\". The latest Bird of Prey Persecution Report for Scotland has found many raptors which were previously driven to national and regional extinction have made significant recoveries in recent years. Species have experienced population increases either through natural re-colonisation or concerted re-introduction programmes by humans. A total of 27 birds of prey were confirmed as being killed as a direct result of persecution in 2002, according to the study. Fifteen of the 27 raptors were poisoned, including seven buzzards, two golden eagles, two white-tailed eagles, one red kite, one sparrow-hawk and two peregrine falcons. In addition, two crows, three rooks, two magpies and 20 unidentified birds were found poisoned. The remaining 12 were killed as a result of what the RSPB terms \"direct\" persecution, meaning they were either shot, caught in cage or spring traps or died as a result of their nests being destroyed. Those killed by direct persecution included three peregrines, eight buzzards and one red kite. Many of those raptors killed were predominantly found in areas of game-rearing interest, the report shows. For red kites, the figures represent a massive reduction on the persecution figures for the previous year, in which there were an unprecedented ten confirmed cases of poisoning for the species. However, although the report shows a change in fortunes for the red kite, the apparent improvement is largely undermined by RSPB figures yet to be published for 2003. Although it will not report on last year's raptor persecution incidents until the beginning of 2005, the organisation already knows that ten red kites were killed last year. Also of particular note for 2002 was the killing of two white-tailed eagles. This equals all the known white-tailed eagle poisonings for the entire 25 year re-introduction programme since it began. The loss of breeding adults is the most damaging form of persecution that the long-lived, slow-breeding eagles can suffer. In order to prevent the continuation of raptor persecution, the RSPB report recommends that better enforcement of wildlife legislation and strengthening of the law to protect those species affected should remain a priority. It also calls on the Scottish Executive to fully implement the Nature Conservation Bill, which contains stronger measures to deal with wildlife crime in Scotland. Keith Morton, RSPB Scotland's investigations officer, said: \"In some areas, a 19th-century attitude seems to still exist, whereby any predatory bird becomes a target. This is an outdated and deplorable attitude. We plan to assist the police with every criminal case we hear about and hope to see the tough new laws against this kind of activity used to the full to discourage it from happening any further.\" RSPB Scotland's Adam Harper added: \"All birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981. As of last spring, wildlife was given even greater protection and wildlife criminals could now face prison. The Scottish Parliament is also currently looking at enhanced legislation with the Nature Conservation Bill.\" Commenting on the 2002 report, Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), said: \"I really feel that since the SGA was set up the poisoning incidents have been reducing and have fallen every year.\"", "date": ["1981", "2002", "2003", "beginning of 2005", "last spring", "last year", "21st century", "19th century", "spring"], "place": ["Scotland", "Scottish"], "person": ["Adam Harper", "Alex Hogg", "Keith Morton", "Bill"], "organization": ["Royal Society", "SGA", "Scotsman", "Scottish Gamekeepers Association"]}, {"docID": "20040301_84", "docDate": "Mar 2 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Concerned about political fallout from asecond black bearhunt, the McGreevey administration is quietly urgingwildlife officialsto cancel this year's hunt, several people close tothe issue said.

The condition of the cats and the home were typical of an animal hoarder, a person who \"collects\" animals WAY past his or her ability to care for them. This home was filthy and full of cat feces and trash. The cats were thin, some had genetic deformities, many were deaf and had large areas of patchy or missing fur. So, thinking about this disorder, the boss went to the Tufts University Web site which has lots of enlightening and sobering information. They used the following criteria to define animal hoarding: \"More than the typical number of companion animals. Inability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, shelter, and veterinary care, with this neglect often resulting in starvation, illness, and death. Denial of the inability to provide this minimum care and the impact of that failure on the animals, the household, and human occupants of the dwelling.\" These cases most often come to light when the \"crazy lady with all the cats\" down the street is brought to the attention of authorities by a neighbor, family member or health care professional. Sometimes utility workers who notice a foul smell from a residence or garage will contact the police and the truth of what is occurring at the residence comes out. The homes are often unlivable to anyone but the individual who resides there. Many of the homes of these people must be condemned once the enforcement case has come to an end because the interior of the home is so damaged by animal waste and filth it cannot be reclaimed.

And the sporadic blackouts that plagued much of China last year are raising complicated questions for the Communist Party and for the rest of the world: .How and where will China get the energy it needs to maintain its economic growth? And how much will the environment suffer for it? .\"It's one of the hottest issues facing the international energy industry,\" said Scott Roberts, chief representative in the Beijing office of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Massachusetts. \"The growth has been explosive, and I think it has caught many people in China and elsewhere off guard.\" .China's emergence has already roiled commodities markets as the country has become a voracious consumer of energy and raw materials. .Last year, its oil imports rose nearly one-third. It also built so many new cars, factories, airports and high-rise buildings that it passed the United States to become the world's biggest steel importer, according to the Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau, a British-based information clearinghouse for the steel industry. .Electricity consumption jumped by 15 percent. Domestic coal production rose by 100 million tons - and still there were shortages. .Yet China's appetite today is modest compared with what is estimated for the future; the country's energy needs are expected to more than double by 2020. This prospect has the Communist Party reportedly rolling out plans for at least 100 new power plants, including nuclear, hydropower and coal-fired ones. It has also raised concerns that efforts to improve China's polluted environment will be muted by the demand for power. .Plans call for at least 20 nuclear plants to be built by 2020. Hydropower projects, regarded by many Chinese officials as a clean power source, are threatening to disrupt the ecological balance along many important rivers that flow out of the high Tibetan plateau. .Accounting for almost 70 percent of China's power supply, coal is a primary source of greenhouse gases, and experts say that by 2020 China could pass the United States as the world's biggest source of carbon monoxide. The fact that this is happening is perhaps not surprising because America is an economic, if not a political, model for China. .\"The fundamental problem is that China is following the path of the United States, and probably the world cannot afford a second United States,\" said Zhang Jianyu, program manager for the Beijing office of Environmental Defense, a U.S.-based advocacy group. .In an address this month before the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao captured the competing pressures of the economy when he cited environmental protection and called for building a \"conservation-minded society\" while also exhorting the country to develop more energy sources. .\"We must speed up the development of large coal mines, important power-generating facilities and power grids, the exploration and exploitation of petroleum and other important resources,\" he said. .Zhang said China's environmental degradation was already being measured in economic losses. He said state officials estimated that acid rain caused about $13 billion in damage annually, while air pollution reduces the annual gross domestic product by about 3 percent. .China is also often inefficient in its energy use. Roberts, the Cambridge Energy consultant, said that the worst Chinese industries wasted 70 percent more energy than their counterparts in the United States. He also noted that China's electricity consumption grew 15 percent last year and 10.4 percent in 2002 - a spike in demand that he said was equal to the total power consumption of Brazil. \"They are adding a middle-sized country every two years in terms of energy consumption,\" he said. .This helps explain why energy security is an increasingly important issue for Chinese leaders, particularly regarding oil. China began importing oil in the early 1990s, partly because its own supplies were leveling out but also because of rising demand. Now the U.S. invasion of Iraq has shown a nation dependent on Middle East oil how vulnerable it could become. .An analysis of China's energy situation made in December by Deutsche Bank said that in response to the Iraq war, China had begun building storage facilities to create a strategic oil reserve. The report also said the country was aggressively pursuing oil deals around the world, from neighboring Kazakhstan and Russia to fields as far away as South America and Canada. .For now, power officials are warning that another spate of blackouts is likely. Last year, nearly two-thirds of the provinces and autonomous regions of China experienced varying degrees of blackouts. This year, officials say, could be as bad or maybe worse.

Their population is estimated at more than two million against only around 160,000 reds. Why can?t they live together? The problem, apparently, is that while both eat similar diets, greys hold the evolutionary advantage, being capable of digesting large seeds from broadleaved trees. Reds, meanwhile, are heavily dependent on traditional Scots spruce trees ? which are currently in decline. What?s more the larger greys eat more and can digest unripe acorns and seeds.

With every funding dollar stretched to the breaking point, more and more refuges and their barebones staffs rely on volunteers and \"Friends of\" groups to help preserve these precious patches of the Earth. Started by Teddy Roosevelt in 1903, the refuge system now has 542 wildlife refuges across the United States. Today, 240 refuge \"friends\" groups with a combined 30,000 to 40,000 volunteers give their time to support refuges. The National Wildlife Refuge System is critically dependent on the lasting commitment and untiring effort of the thousands of people each year who volunteer their precious time to work on refuges around the country. They come from all walks of life and bring a wide diversity of talents and experience to the task.... biologists, birders, educators, artists, photographers, carpenters, plumbers, mechanics secretaries, architects, planners, and many, many more. Sometimes they contribute from a distance, donating photographs, doing library research, drafting text and art for brochures, etc. More often you'll find them when you visit refuges, as they are clearing walking trails, cleaning up trash, rebuilding facilities, operating big equipment, gathering water samples or restoring habitat.

Not only had the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb years before the Americans predicted they would, but now they were leading the \"space race.\" In response, the Defense Department approved funding for a new U.S. satellite project, headed by former Nazi SS officer Wernher von Braun, and created, in 1958, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to make certain that the United States forever after maintained \"a lead in applying state-of-the-art technology for military capabilities and to prevent technological surprise from her adversaries.\" Almost half a century later, what's left of the USSR is a collapsed group of half-failed states, while the U.S. stands alone as the globe's sole hyperpower. Yet DARPA, the agency for an arms-race world, seems only to be warming up to the chase. There may be no country left to take the lead from us, the nearest military competitor being China which reportedly had $65 billion in military expenditures in 2002 (compared to our $466 billion according to GlobalSecurity.org) and which, only in 2003, put its first \"Taikonaut\" into outer space. Undaunted, DARPA continues to develop high-tech weapons systems for 2025-2050 and beyond - some of them standard fare like your run-of-the-mill. hypersonic bombers, others more exotic. In an August 2003 article, Los Angeles Times reporter Charles Pillar noted that DARPA has put forth some of the \"most boneheaded ideas ever to spring from the government\" -- including a \"mechanical elephant\" that never made it into the jungles of Vietnam and telepathy research that never quite afforded the U.S. the ability to engage in psychic spying. As former DARPA Director Charles Herzfeld noted in 1975, \"When we fail, we fail big.\" Little has changed. According to DARPA's current chief, some 85%-90% of its projects fail to meet their full objectives.

Indiana's no-call law covers business solicitations and calls from charities that use professional telemarketers, but exempts charities that use their own volunteers and/or employees. One of the toughest do-not-call laws in the United States, the list administered by the Indiana attorney general went into effect Jan. 1, 2002. Since then, the attorney general's office has logged more than 6,000 complaints about violations of the law from consumers. It has reached voluntary compliance agreements with 139 companies accused of violating the rule. Of those, 124 also paid fines that, so far, total $351,000. Professional fund-raisers also are required to register their Indiana telemarketing campaigns with the state. Two years ago, when Attorney General Steve Carter first published the list on his Web site, www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/consumer/charityfundraisers.htm, it contained 350 active campaigns. The newest list, effective Jan. 1, contains 331 active campaigns -- very nearly the same number. (see chart, Pages 8-9B) \"Right now, it just narrows down who they can call,\" said Summer Burgin, a spokeswoman for Carter's office. Professional telemarketers still have a million Hoosier residential lines they legitimately can call, as well as business phone numbers, which are not part of the no-call program. And those calls can be quite lucrative for the telemarketing firms. Fifty of the current Indiana campaigns guarantee just 1 percent to the charity, with the professional fund-raiser claiming the remainder. That's actually better than the 2002 list, on which 100 campaigns promised just 1 percent to the charity. Although state law says the donations split should represent a good faith estimate of the final breakdown, \"some choose to go to the end of the spectrum,\" Burgin said. That's because some professional fund-raisers who register campaigns with the state don't want to be held to a higher number should costs exceed their expectations.

Unfortunately, he says, the difference between a city facility and a non profit shelter like the Humane Society is the amount of time that animals can be held. Acevedo says that they can only hold the animal from three to five days. \"We do hold on to adoptable animals as long as we can, and we do our best to find them homes,\" he says, but there is a capacity issue. \"We've held dogs up to two weeks, as long as we have room,\" he says.Acevedo, who has worked for the city for 11 years and previously worked for the Humane Society, says that when he gets in an animal that is adoptable, he tries his best to find it a home. \"When a cute dog comes in, I let everyone know about it.

Tucker is talking about horses and pointing to what looks like a garage door. This is the door the horses will walk through to be killed -- horses that somebody sold for a few hundred bucks or less: the old ones, the slow ones, the mean ones, the lame ones, the ugly ones. Chances are, each horse will have a name. Chances are, each one will have pulled a load or carried a rider or eaten sugar from a child's hand. But the moment it goes through this door, its status will plummet to mere livestock, just a cow with spirit. Then, in the next day or two, it will be killed and skinned and gutted, carved into steaks and chops, and shipped to countries across the seas where people eat horse meat. The slaughterhouse is in DeKalb, 60 miles west of Chicago, and Tucker runs the place.Which puts him in a tough spot. \"No doubt about it,\" he says Friday morning, walking through the place, giving a tour. \"It's an issue with some people.\" How much of an issue? What happens when you tell people what you do for a living? \"For every 10 people, I'd say that maybe one or two are amazed,\" Tucker replies. \"They won't talk about it. Most of the rest will say, 'I don't think there's anything wrong with that.' And a couple will say, 'Good for you.'\"Cavel International, a Belgian firm, operated a slaughterhouse for horses in DeKalb from 1987 to 2002. Some people in town protested, but Tucker likes to pull out old business stories from the local papers about how great it was for DeKalb. When the slaughterhouse burned down in 2002, Cavel decided to rebuild. The new plant -- a big block of gray concrete in the boonies of DeKalb -- is scheduled to open in a couple of weeks. It would employ 30 to 40 workers and could handle the slaughter of 100 horses a day.A bill pending in Springfield, however, would close down the slaughterhouse before the first horses even showed up. The bill, which would ban the slaughter of horses in Illinois for human consumption, was approved by the Senate last year.

Do elephants, dolphins, cats, magpies, mice, salmon, ants or bees know who they are? Was Jethro, my late companion dog, a self-conscious being? Do any of these animals have a sense of self? What do these animals make of themselves when they look in a mirror, see their reflection in water, hear their own or another's song or howl, or smell themselves and others? Is it possible that self-awareness - \"Wow that's me!\" - is a uniquely human trait?Because there's much interest and much exciting work to be done concerning what animals know about themselves, it's worth reflecting on what we do and don't know about animal selves. There are academic and practical reasons to do so.In his book, \"The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex,\" Charles Darwin pondered what animals might know about themselves. He wrote: \"It may be freely admitted that no animal is self-conscious, if by this term it is implied that he reflects on such points, as whence he comes or whither he will go, or what is life and death, and so forth.\" Darwin also championed the notion of evolutionary continuity and believed that animals had some sense of self. In the same book, he wrote, \"Nevertheless, the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind.\" Thus, there are shades of gray and not black-and-white differences between humans and other animals in cognitive abilities. So, while animals might not ponder life and death the way humans do, they still may have some sense of self.After decades of studying animals ranging from coyotes, gray wolves, domestic dogs, and Adlie penguins and other birds, I've come to the conclusion that not only are some animals self-aware, but also that there are degrees of self-awareness. Combined with studies by my colleagues, it's wholly plausible to suggest that many animals have a sense of \"mine-ness\" or \"body-ness.\" So, for example, when an experimental treatment, an object, or another individual affects an individual, he or she experiences that \"something is happening to this body.\" Many primates relax when being groomed and individuals of many species actively seek pleasure and avoid pain. There's no need to associate \"this body\" with \"my body\" or with \"me\" (or \"I\"). Many animals also know the placement in space of parts of their body as they run, jump, perform acrobatics, or move as a coordinated hunting unit or flock without running into one another. They know their body isn't someone else's body", "person": ["Charles Darwin", "David Graybeard", "Jane Goodall", "Jethro"]}, {"docID": "20040329-2_34", "docDate": "Mar 31 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "And the winners are ... - Overall Rescue Cat of the Year for 2004: Chrissie - Wolverhampton feline whose purr therapy and ability to make children feel loved make her a firm favourite on the children's ward of the local hospital.

Factors affecting the increase in unwanted animals include the State's population growth and the inadequate funding of State and local animal welfare programs. The General Assembly finds, however, that the primary cause of the increase in unwanted animals is uncontrolled breeding.

Americans, or Yanks as they are often called up north, are frequently verbally assailed by Canadians with the misplaced and perhaps na?ve notion that all U.S. citizens are swine when it comes to caring for and preserving quality country.Canadians, in contrast, are valiant, conscientious souls who have no blood on their hands. This stance is at best spurious and possibly created to hide the fact that the western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon are being plundered at an astonishing rate.While I was having a couple of drinks in a bar called The Pit in Dawson City, Yukon, last summer, a Canadian came up to me and asked where I was from. When I told him he said, \"You damn Yanks don't give a damn about your own land. You log it and stripmine it all to hell. Then you come up here to enjoy our country.\" Over the years I've heard many comments along those lines. True, there are individuals in Canada who have devoted their lives to preserving the land and there are, as most of us know all too well, greedy people tearing apart the last remaining shreds of unspoiled country in the United States. But fair is fair, and the bottom line is that Canadians should take stock of their own environmental situation before gleefully casting aspersions America's way.Forty years of being an inveterate road bum, traveling back roads on a skinny budget, fishing malarial bogs, inadvertently canoeing class V whitewater, hiking nonexistent trails bound for nowhere, and unavoidably staying on top of environmental issues in Canada has provided me an ongoing opportunity to see disturbing change in a land of incredible splendor and abundance ? one peopled with some truly remarkable, generous, and creative individuals. But in the last five years, these destructive shifts in direction have been seismic, both metaphorically and literally.Land Under SiegeThe notion that Canada is the great white sustainable north is not wholly without merit. On the Environmental Sustainability Index, developed by Columbia and Yale Universities, Canada is ranked fourth and the United States 45th. Canada allows industrial hemp production, while the United States prohibits it, and is also a signatory to the U.S.-shunned Kyoto Treaty on global warming.But when it comes to allowing extractive industries to run rampant, Canada may be king. From Fort Nelson in northern British Columbia to Rocky Mountain House in central Alberta to the vast Tintina Trench region in the southern Yukon and over east to Yellowknife on Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, the landscape is under siege. The extraction industries are running the show, tearing, blasting, sucking, and cutting every diamond, gold nugget, drop of oil, chunk of coal, and stick of timber they can access. If it's of value, these industries intend to have it.What's going down in western Canada puts the devastation being visited on states like Montana, Wyoming, and West Virginia look mild by comparison. What are obviously horrendous clearcuts or devastating open-pit coalmines in the U.S. West are everyday situations in Canada too. Both countries are mining their natural resources at an alarming rate.Canadian provincial campgrounds are filled to the brim with late-model pickups tricked out with all the options and pulling expensive fifth wheelers and pricey speedboats, ATVs, and jet skis. The Cypress Hills section along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, the setting for Wallace Stegner's book Wolf Willow, are now so overrun as to resemble a scene from National Lampoon's Vacation. Housing developments in cities such as Calgary and Edmonton stretch for miles with thousands of quarter-million-dollar homes. All of this comes not only from the jobs provided by these corporations but also from royalties paid by the industry based on the amount of a given mineral extracted from a province. In Alberta, this figure exceeds $6 billion annually just for coal. The money is flowing in direct proportion to the abundance of the oil coming from countless wells hammered into the Canadian countryside.

Mar?a Aznar. He described bullfighting as a \"noble dance between bull and man.\" Editorialists at many Spanish newspapers criticized the vote, saying it evoked the time of dictator rule under Franco.

Cases of impotence are on the rise, and so is the demand for traditional cures like seal penises, sea horses, geckos and other exotic ingredients that many Chinese believe confer virility. The problem: the growing demand for these ingredients is driving many species of wildlife to the brink of extinction. Von Hippel, a psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia, was intrigued enough to visit apothecaries in Hong Kong and Beijing, where he saw a bewildering array of dried penises in all shapes and sizes. Then, in 1998, Viagra made its debut in the West.Later that year, while von Hippel was hiking near Anchorage with his brother Frank, a biologist at the University of Alaska, the siblings decided to write a letter to the journal Science, proposing that this pill, at $10 a pop, could quell demand for \"animal sexual potency products\" and prove a boon not only for Chinese men but for endangered species. To their surprise, Science published the letter even though \"we had no data,\" says William.

We don?t eat meat, avoid cosmetics tested on animals and boycott the Ringling Brothers Circus. Drape ourselves in fur? Forget it. Animal rights advocates don?t even wear leather or woolMany people view advocates as certifiable, grade-A, top-of-the-class nutcases. Reduced to the essentials, however, what we believe is just common sense. We believe the animals killed for food, trapped for fur, used in laboratories or trained to jump through hoops are unique somebodies ? not generic somethings. What happens to them matters to them. What happens to them makes a difference to the quality and duration of their lives. In these respects, animal rights advocates believe humans and these animals are the same ? equal.

Not train them to jump through hoops. ?Not larger cages,? we say, ?empty cages.? ?Humane treatment? Comparatively speaking, few people are animal rights advocates. Why? Part of the answer concerns our disparate beliefs about how often animals are treated badly. Animal rights advocates believe this is a tragedy of incalculable proportions. Nonadvocates believe mistreatment occurs hardly at all. That nonadvocates think this way seems eminently reasonable. After all, we have laws governing how animals may be treated and a cadre of government inspectors who make sure these laws are obeyed. In the language of our most important federal legislation ? the Animal Welfare Act ? animals must receive ?humane care and treatment.? In other words, animals must be treated with sympathy, kindness, mercy and compassion ? the very meaning of the word ?humane.? It says so in any standard dictionary. For fiscal year 2001, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service conducted 12,000 inspections. Of that total, only 140 sites were reported for possible violations because of improper handling of animals. That works out to a compliance rate of almost 99 percent.

In some areas the stuff was absorbed into porous rock formations, cooked by the earth's core and transformed into the substance called oil. There it sat until 1859, when a former railroad conductor drilled the world's first oil well near Titusville, Pennsylvania. Since then, 50,000 more have been drilled, and the substance has transformed human civilization. But we're running out. Of the 2 trillion readily extractable barrels of oil that once lay under the earth's surface, humans have managed to find, pump and burn nearly a trillion.

Even according to the rosier estimates favored by some scientists, the end of the line will come before the end of this century. Of course, doomsayers made similar warnings during the oil shocks of the '70s, and their predictions were falsified when new discoveries outpaced usage. But things are different now, argues Goodstein. Working from calculations by geophysicist M. King Hubbert, he shows that oil production typically follows a bell-shaped pattern. In America, for instance, new discoveries led to a production surge in the early 20th century. But output peaked in 1970 - as Hubbert predicted 14 years earlier - and has been declining ever since. According to Goodstein's analysis, this bell-shaped pattern is now playing out internationally. New discoveries have been flat in recent years. And the author believes the world will likely hit the top of its production curve - the \"Hubbert peak\" - sometime in the next decade. After that, output will fall, even as demand from industrializing nations such as China skyrockets. In response to price shocks, many consumers will switch to natural gas.

Use of the methods by livestock producers, meat inspectors, or export companies, for example, should provide greater flexibility in where, when, and how they measure ractopamine residues in animals. Such monitoring helps the U.S. meat industry safeguard against illicit use or accidental exposure. It also ensures good trade relations with the European Union, which disallows animal growth promoters like ractopamine and other beta-adrenergic agonists. So say Weilin Shelver, a chemist, and David Smith, an animal physiologist, in the Animal Metabolism-Agricultural Chemicals Research Unit of ARS's Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo.  Their first method is an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the second is an optical biosensor. Both use a specialized type of protein called a monoclonal antibody. The scientists developed this antibody using modern biotechnology techniques. Both methods are fast, easy to use, specific, and sensitive, and they give similar measurements, notes Shelver. \"The major difference is in how they make the measurements,\" she adds. \"An advantage of the biosensor is that it sometimes gives less interference, or background noise, from the other materials in the sample.\" In the United States, ractopamine has been approved for use in pigs since 2001 and cattle since 2003.

It was launched in 2000 to help restore public confidence in the farming industry after a series of food scares. The scheme is an umbrella term which unites a variety of quality assurance schemes developed for specific branches of farming with a set of common minimum standards. There are additional standards for abbatoirs, processing units and hauliers. The scheme now covers between 65 per cent and 90 per cent of output in the main commodities. The Red Tractor symbol claims to be evidence that farmers \"are practising high standards of animal welfare, food safety and environmental practices\". However, an investigation carried out by animal rights organisation Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) claims that the Little Red Tractor logo \"offers few assurances that animals are treated any better than the bare minimum legal guidelines\". Under the scheme, practises such as the intensive rearing of broiler chickens, the use of narrow farrowing crates for breeding pigs, the use of battery cages for laying hens and animal mutations such as the debeaking of chickens and the tail docking of pigs are still permitted. CIWF claims that the Red Tractor scheme is \"more concerned with creating the image of welfare rather than the reality\". The logo is also not a guarantee that the product is British. It can be used on produce which comes from other countries as long as the producers comply with the necessary standards. FREEDOM FOOD This farm-assurance scheme, administered by the RSPCA, was set up in 1994. Like the Red Tractor, it is a voluntary scheme which farms, hauliers and abbatoirs can apply to join, and covers eggs, meat and dairy products. It implements RSPCA species-specific welfare standards based on the \"five freedoms\" defined by the Farm Animal Welfare Council: freedom from fear and distress; freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; freedom to express normal behaviour. Businesses are admitted to the scheme only when an approved assessor has carried out a detailed audit. Spot checks are also carried out. Before the logo can be applied, all stages of a food?s production, eg farm, haulier and abattoir, must be accredited. However, the Freedom Food logo does not mean that the food is free-range. The RSPCA will accredit indoor systems of animal rearing provided the animal has plenty of room to move around and good access to food and water.

Now, ifa Bronx lawmaker has his way, they will have to take out yet anotherpolicy - one for their dogs.State Assemblyman Peter M. Rivera, a Democrat whose district is in theBronx, proposed a new bill last month that, if passed, would require alldog owners in New York State to have liability insurance for their pets.The bill, which Mr. Rivera said would probably be ready for debate on theAssembly floor in a month, is called \"Elijah's Law\" for a 3-year-old boy,Elijah Torres, who was seriously injured in an attack by a Rottweiler inthe Bronx last fall. AdvertisementThe law would circumvent the major sticking point in dog attack cases inNew York City, Mr. Rivera said. Currently, an attack victim can takelegal action only if a dog is documented as \"dangerous,\" a designationassigned only after the dog has already bitten, he said. \"There's an old doctrine that says an owner is not liable until a dog isdeclared dangerous,\" Mr. Rivera said. \"My legislation would require thatany dog owner has to have insurance.\"A summary of the bill offered grim statistics. In 2002, a total of 5,176dog bites were reported in New York City, it stated darkly. Nationwide,dogs bite about 7,000 mail carriers a year, it said. (The PostalService's Web site noted that the count, taken in 1983, fell by half bythe late 1990's.)More children, according to the summary, visit emergency rooms for dogbites than for the total of injuries on playgrounds and from bicycles,mopeds, all-terrain vehicles, in-line skating, and skateboards combined.Mr. Rivera said compliance would be affordable, costing between $75 and$100 annually. Still, it was not clear whether insurance companies wouldagree with the figures.Other questions have been raised. It took years for New York Statedrivers to finally surrender to mandatory vehicle insurance in the late1950's. How long would they drag their heels with their dogs?In New York City, officials from the city's main animal shelter and theDepartment of Health cautioned that laws already require dog owners topurchase licenses for their pets, as proof that the animal has beenvaccinated, but only about one fifth of all dog owners actually comply.City residents own about 530,000 dogs, but only about 110,000 arelicensed, according to Department of Health estimates. \"It's a very anemic licensing program in New York City,\" said EdwardBoks, executive director of Animal Care and Control, a group the cityemploys to run its animal shelters, which take in 45,000 lost cats, dogsand other animals each year.Then there is the problem of making sure all dogs are insured. \"It's wonderful to have these laws, but enforcing them costs money,\" Mr.Boks said. \"We have a very difficult time enforcing the leash law and thelicense law.\"Still, Mr. Rivera said, the state should make an attempt.\"It may be a burden, but it's a positive burden.\"", "date": ["1983", "2002", "last fall", "last month", "late 1950's", "late 1990's"], "money": ["$100", "$75", "$100", "$75"], "place": ["Bronx", "New York City", "New York State"], "person": ["Edward Boks", "Elijah", "Elijah Torres", "Law", "State Assemblyman Peter M.

As of Monday afternoon, about 24 hours after theraid, an estimated 100 people still remained to bebooked, Robinson said.   Most of those arrested were charged withmisdemeanor animal cruelty, the sheriff said.   Robinson said he did not know whether any felonycharges would result from the bust. Under Georgia law,animal cruelty can be prosecuted as a felony if aperson ''knowingly or maliciously'' causes the deathor disfigurement of an animal.   The bust culminated an eight-month investigationthat began with aneighbor's complaint and eventuallygrew to include the FBI, Georgia Bureau ofInvestigation, Athens-Clarke County police and otherpolice agencies, Robinson said.   Initially, investigators thought the case wassolely a cockfighting investigation, but last weekheard that dogfighting was also being practiced at afarm on Hancock Bridge Road, the sheriff said.Investigators flew over in a helicopter Thursday andwere able to pick out what looked like eight to 10 dogkennels, he added.   Investigators had expected to book only about 100people in the raid. Because so many more were arrestedthan expected, by Monday afternoon law officers stillhad not been able to execute the search warrants theyhad carried with them to the farm off Georgia Highway11 near the Jackson County line, Robinson said.

Suspected gamblers included people from SouthCarolina, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee and evenCalifornia, judging from the tags on impoundedvehicles, Robinson said.   Most of those arrested were Mexican immigrants, hesaid.

It's also an unseasonably hot day, and running up this hill isn't making me smell any sweeter.Dragging along behind me, on a piece of twine, is a sock that's been stuffed with pebbles and rags, and liberally doused with the oil, rabbit-juice and curry powder. Wherever I run, it leaves an invisible trial that, somewhere in the woods below, seven sharp-nosed hounds are following to track me down.It may be distinctly low-tech, but this malodorous sock-on-a-string is at the heart of a country sport that could see a massive surge in popularity if the Government makes good its election promise to ban hunting with hounds. Drag-hunting is similar to conventional hunting in many respects, except that hunters and their hounds follow an artificial scent laid by a runner or a pony, rather than chasing live animals such as foxes or deer. On the face of it, this \"cruelty-free\" brand appears to offer a neat compromise between animal-welfare campaigners and hunting supporters - but many die-hard hunters simply don't see it that way.There is one other important distinction, especially for me as today's quarry: I won't be mauled by a pack of hungry dogs and then shot, when they eventually track me down.

When it comes to the current laws regarding the withdrawal of feeding tubes in the terminally ill and permanently comatose, this sound bit of practical advice needs to be heeded.But recently the Pope proclaimed that feeding tubes should never be withdrawn from any patient and that health-care providers are morally obligated to provide nutrition and hydration regardless of a patient's wishes. The Pope's order spells trouble for your health care -- not only because it threatens to undermine a powerful social consensus in the United States about your right to refuse medical treatment, but also because it means you can no longer be sure whether a hospital will respect your request or that of your loved ones making a decision for you.In comments March 20 before the World Federation of Catholic Medical Associations, the Pope stated that patients who are permanently comatose are \u201calways human\u201d and \u201cnever become \u2018vegetables\u2019 or \u2018animals.'\" He went on to say that nutrition and hydration should be provided indefinitely even if there is no hope of a patient's recovery.The Pope\u2019s position is directly at odds with current clinical practice in U.S. hospitals.

I critisized the law, he only wanted  to brand me and animal rights as radical.  2) On 15th April also, the by far biggest weekly magazine in Austria  arranged a debate between the head of the government comission on the  animal issue, the battery farmer of Austria's largest battery farm  (450.000 hens), the agricultural minister and me, believe it or not. The  comission spokeswoman critisized the government but was very held back  in her arguments. The battery farmer was shocked to see me on the table  and said I belong in prison and not here. He would have refused to come  had he known I was here, he said. He claimed to love his birds and that  his way of keeping them is in their best interest. The minister doubted  that I as a vegan are in a position to debate the keeping of farm  animals. He said consumers should decide, not the law. I said that only  vegans can really represent the animals' interests, because only they  have not their own interests in the animals, i.e. they do not suffer a  collision of interests between theirs and those of the animals. We had  broken into 5 battery farms owned by the battery farmer on the table and  had brought him to court, in answer he had brought charges against me,  so the two of us were not too friendly with each other. But eventually,  it became a hot debate between the minister and me on battery farming.  The whole thing lasted 2 hours and was supposed to be published  yesterday, but was delayed for a week. I hope its not the Conservatives  succeeding in trying to hinder it.  3) Today, just now, we have our 54th demo for a battery farm ban since  21st February, when we started with the demo campaign. In our latest  siege of the ministry of agriculture on Wednesday 21st, the minister  actually came out and confronted the activists. He claims we should not  protest outside his ministry, as he is not in the position to ban  battery farming, only the government can do that.  4) The flyposting is running on a high. So far, 1500 placards have been  put up everywhere. 2 people have been arrested while flyposting, quite a  new police tactic. It has not been known that ever anybody has been  arrested for such an offence. Also, as there are presidential elections  this Sunday, the Conservatives have started paying watch groups to guard  their placards and chase activists putting up anti-conservative posters.  A number of confrontations were had, but all went ok, i.e. so far all  activists escaped unharmed.  5) For the presidential elections, we had asked all candidates on their  opinion on battery farming and the animal issue. The conservative  candidate was the only one trying to evade anwering our questions. She  said she finds the law as it is sufficient. We put as much energy as  possible into spreading this view, through demos and posters and  leafletting etc. She reacted last Sunday 19th by putting out a press  release saying that the law, indeed, should be tightened. Obviously she  feels the pressure, although she did not want to say exactly in which  way the law should be tightened. Yesterday, activists tried to disrupt  her last public rally before the elections tomorrow. Police intervened,  but some disruption was achieved and our banners were visible to  everybody. Lets hope she is not our new president after this Sunday.  6) But yesterday we succeeded in our biggest coup as yet. On Thursday,  the agricultural chamber had organized a visit with experts to the first  Austrian battery farm with enriched cages. Their press release said how  wonderful this farm is, and what a compromise, with happy healthy birds.  As it happened, in the night after this visit, and BEFORE their press  release went out, activists visited the very same farm in the night and  got good footage of fotos and videos of the farm and its awful  conditions, of dead rotting birds in the cages and of birds without  feathers. So, we were in the position to counter their PA immediately  with our own PA that showed pictures of the very same farm which were  only 5 hours old!! They must have been steaming, as well as wondering  where in their midst the whistle blower might be!!  7) In preparing new actions, I have spoken to journalists from state TV.  They told me that our campaign is a big issue in the internal media  world and they admire us for how much pressure we have managed to  create. Nice to hear.  8) I have managed to persuade all big Austrian national animal welfare  and animal rights groups to pay together an advert, which is an appeal  to the prime minister to ban battery farming, signed by 50 prominent  Austrians from arts and science. On next Tuesday, the day of the  parliamentary debate, this advert will be published half page in the  conservative daily newspaper. If it is perceived well, I might get the  groups to finance publishing the same advert in a number of other  newspapers, especially since many newspapers drop costs by more than 50%  and up to 100%.", "date": ["27th of April", "April", "February", "Thursday", "Today", "Wednesday", "Yesterday", "beginning of March", "last Sunday", "next Tuesday", "this Sunday", "today", "tomorrow", "yesterday"], "place": ["Austria", "PA"], "organization": ["Conservative Party", "Police"], "time": "night"}, {"docID": "20040426_4", "docDate": "Apr 26 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "For Immediate ReleaseFUND FOR ANIMALS SAYS STATE IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OF 13 YEAR OLD HUNTERAUSTIN, TX (April 26, 2004) The Fund for Animals, a national animal protection organization which operates Black Beauty Ranch, a world-famous 1600 acre sanctuary in Murchison, Texas, has called on Governor Rick Perry to establish a minimum hunting age of sixteen. The call comes in response to the death of 13 year old Michael Lynn Russell who was shot and killed on April 19 while hunting with his 11 year old cousin on the Lone Star Hereford Ranch in Clay County. Texas has no minimum hunting age, and does not require hunter safety classes for children under 17.In a letter to Governor Perry, program coordinator Norm Phelps called that policy so irresponsible that the Government of the State of Texas is directly responsible for the death of Michael Russell, since such tragedies are an entirely foreseeable result of DPW policy. Young children lack the patience, emotional control, and mature judgement to operate a firearm safely or take prudent precautions to assure their own safety in a hunting situation where close oversight by an adult is often impossible. The presence of his adult uncle did not protect Michael. Children are by nature excitable, impatient, and impulsive; that is part of being a child. In the excitement of a hunt, children even the most responsible of them cannot be counted on to exercise the caution and restraint that are the essential ingredients of hunting safety.According to Fund for Animals president Michael Markarian, Nationwide, the hunting industry is trying to increase their revenues by recruiting children. But the state of Texas needs to just say no to corporate and bureaucratic greed that puts children at risk. Our children's lives are more important than the sale of hunting licenses.

The April 18 raid on a Hancock Bridge Road farmresulted in 238 arrests on misdemeanor charges ofanimal cruelty and gambling. A couple leasing thefarm, Larry Otis Fleming Jr. and Misty Fleming, werecharged with felony-grade animal cruelty and gambling.   Law enforcement officials believe the farm was avenue for cockfights and dog fights with pit bullterriers on most Sundays. The sting was the result ofan eight-month investigation by a handful of local,state and federal police agencies.   Many of those arrested were Mexican immigrantshailing from states throughout the Southeast,according to news reports. While legal in Mexico,cockfighting is banned in the United States in everystate except Louisiana and New Mexico.   In addition to seizing more than $130,000 in cashduring last week's bust, Barrow County officials alsotook custody of nearly 140 fighting roosters and sixdogs.   It was the second such raid on a major gambling andanimal fighting ring in Northeast Georgia this year.More than 100 people were arrested in Newton Countyduring a dog-fighting sting in January.   Illegal animal fighting is not a new phenomenon,but in the past, it has been limited to small,transient operations. The stings in Barrow and Newtoncounties uncovered the illegal practice on a muchlarger scale - more gamblers, more animals and moremoney.   Because animal fighting is often considered agateway crime - one which fosters other illegalactivities, such as drug and weapons trafficking - theappearance of such large and brazen operations in ourregion should be of concern to residents and publicofficials.   Not only do we need to fully enforce existing lawsagainst animal fighting, but these statutes shouldalso be reviewed to ensure they meet our needs.   One area of federal law has been targeted forreinforcement by law enforcement officials, animalrights activists and poultry industry representatives.They believe federal penalties outlined in the AnimalWelfare Act's fighting provisions aren't stiff enoughto prevent violations or encourage prosecution.   Legislation now before Congress would help toughenthis regulation by increasing imprisonment terms fromone year to two. Supporters say the heightenedpenalties are particularly important to curb theillegal interstate transportation of dogs and birdsfor fighting. The bill also would prohibit theinterstate sale or shipping of the razor-sharp spursattached to the legs of cockfighting birds.   Though this measure has been in the works foryears, it has not been acted on yet in this Congress.The delay certainly is not for lack of support. Morethan 51 senators and 196 representatives are listed assponsors, and there are indications the Bushadministration also may back it.   A recent endorsement by the National ChickenCouncil, a poultry industry group, greatly improvedthe legislation's chances. According to a statement onthe council's Web site, the bill will help reduce thedangers associated with the unregulated trade offighting birds. The council believes the interstatetransport of these birds can lead to the spread ofavian diseases, such as Newcastle disease, an outbreakof which could cripple the poultry industry.   So far, Georgia's Sens. Zell Miller and SaxbyChambliss and Rep. Max Burns have not signed on tothis valuable legislation. When this bill comes to avote, we hope our members of Congress will stronglysupport it. If not, they need to be prepared toexplain why.

Canada says it is, citing a report by animal vets to back its position and noting that officials are ready and able to crack down on any inhumane hunters.Most hunting is for young pups, whose pelts fetch more on international markets than seals more than a few months old. Canada's biggest reform was a ban on hunting pups before they shed their white fur, usually about 12 days. Images of those cuddly pups became icons of the 1970s protests against the hunt, which takes place on ice floes across eastern Canada.The debate today comes down to this: Do the young seals die a quick, humane death before hunters skin them?'Swimming reflex?'Roger Simon, who oversees the hunt for Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, says activist video purportedly showing seals being skinned alive is actually showing unconscious or dead seals going through a \"swimming reflex\" \u2014 involuntary movements that mimic swimming. It's akin, he says, to seeing the final seconds of a chicken running with its head cut off.\"It's impossible to skin a live seal, or a conscious one,\" he says. \"Can you imagine trying to skin a live animal ... it would scream and claw.\"Besides, he adds, why would you \"when you can kill it in one second.\"The International Fund for Animal Welfare, which has monitored the hunts for years, counters that hunters often are in such a hurry that they club or shoot as many as possible before going back to check their condition and skin them.\"Mr. Simon cannot dismiss every instance simply with reference to a swimming reflex,\" says IFAW science advisor David Lavigne, a former zoology professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.Video turned over to Canada shows scenes like \"pups being skinned alive and reacting by doing things like lifting up their heads and crying in pain or trying to grab the knife with their front paws,\" Lavigne says. \"These behaviors are not a swimming reflex, these are wounded animals. This year we filmed one seal, left wounded in a pile of dead seals, crying out for nearly an hour while sealers stood nearby.\"Simon doesn't doubt that incident but adds \"you cannot describe the whole industry based on one observation. The fact that some people commit violations is the reason we have fishery officers, helicopters, and surveillance vessels out there to enforce the regulations.\"If you see a video where a pitcher is trying to bean a hitter would you conclude that this is a fair portrayal of Major League Baseball,\" he asks. Canada's 12,000 seal hunters should \"be judged on the vast majority of sealers doing their job properly, not on some selected clips from a video.\"Canada has issued 322 violations over the previous five years, most of them for small infractions.The activists say that in that time they've documented on video what they feel are 660 serious violations of Canada's marine mammal rules.IFAW adds that, while it would prefer to see all hunting stop, it would be satisfied with what it considers compliance with the law. \"A subsidized hunt for baby animals is like paying people to kill kittens with a claw hammer,\" says IFAW spokesman Chris Cutter, \"we are simply asking Canada to abide by and enforce its own rules. ... \"A quick death is much preferred if that's inevitable.\"Vets' reportsSkinning live seals would violate Canada's marine mammal rules as well as its criminal code, which makes it a crime to willfully cause \"unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal or bird.\"", "date": ["1970s", "today", "This year"], "place": ["Canada", "eastern Canada", "Ontario Canada", "Guelph"], "person": ["Roger Simon", "David"], "organization": ["Department of Fisheries", "International Fund for Animal Welfare", "IFAW"]}, {"docID": "20040503-1_12", "docDate": "May 4 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "SEQUIM \u2014 When elk amble across Highway 101 in Sequim on the Olympic Peninsula, radio collars around their necks set off flashing lights up and down the busy road.A continent away, when moose wander across Route 4 in the mountains of western Maine, their hulking bodies break an infrared beam that triggers flashing lights on moose-warning signs.On re-engineered highways between the wireless elk and the beam-breaking moose, there are underpasses for tortoises in California, vibration-detectors for deer in Wyoming and a 52-foot-wide overpass for deer, foxes, coyotes and opossums on Interstate 75 in Florida.At an accelerating pace, federal and state highways across much of the United States are being tricked out with critter-crossing technology, high and low.

One's surroundings include the totality of flora and fauna that influence one in spite of himself. Those that live in coastal town or the littoral states will, doubtless, be influenced by those features that are associated with riverine areas-the luxuriant vegetation, the beautiful landscape aesthetically pleasing. Those that live in the tropics are usually under tropical influences. What I am trying to say is that what influences one in a given time is dependent on the prevailing elements in action.But wait a minute! What is the nexus between the environment and corruption, which this article is proposed to discuss? Just like the environment, our surroundings influence our every day life. We can equally talk in terms of environmental influence on the administrative life of individuals and countries. When, for example, we talk about physical conditions that we work in, we can as well call it work environment just as we talk in terms of political, financial, moral and social environments. Just like the influence of the environment on our lives, we have environmental influences on corruption, that is, the state of affairs that encourages and sustains corruption.As a matter of fact, we are all humans, both black and white, but contemporary observations show that the blacks, especially Africans are more susceptible to corruption. When you ponder over this susceptibility, you are inclined to think whether there are innate brain peculiarities that condition the two races the way they are. After much research, and considering the equally epochal achievements by the blacks, we now know that nature bestows equally on every human being. We are the way we are due to many factors, predominantly environmental.The salaries paid to workers in developed countries are enough to support decent life. In developing countries the salaries cannot even support the life of frugal comfort. Thus, workers in this part of the world must necessarily look elsewhere to make ends meet. In looking elsewhere, some take to robbery, while there are some that do not resist the lure of corruption insofar as it will better their lot. Such states of affairs that make corruption to thrive are the environmental elements of corruption.Talking about crimes in the society, the current debate is whether death penalty should be abolished or not. When viewed critically, you will discover that the magnitude of punishment do not necessarily stop people from committing crimes. The name of the game is survival; to some people it must be at all costs. The fact to note is that people do not often contemplate the punishment awaiting them should they be caught committing crimes; they do not even bear thinking the possibility of being caught. Thus, in reducing crime, the emphasis should be on encouraging the blossoming of the environment that will not encourage crimes. When people are comfortable, when workers receive living salaries/wages, when employment is provided, crimes will reduce.The same applies to corruption. The basic remedy to corruption is by encouraging the blossoming of healthy environment that will not encourage corruption. If policemen were well paid, they will certainly consider the extortion of N20.00 from motorists as infradig. The same applies, mutatis mutantur, to other professions/workers whose nature of job expose them to corruption. __________________________________________________________________________"}, {"docID": "20040503-1_18", "docDate": "May 4 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "WASHINGTON ?

Americans, who have a special love for the animal that carried pioneers into the Wild West, U.S. soldiers into battle and jockeys into racetrack history, are finding the notion of grilled horse steak and horse meat sushi extremely distasteful. When you watch a thoroughbred pulling ahead on the back stretch, remember that \"the winner could be some Frenchman's entree,\" said Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., chairman of the Congressional Horse Caucus, who has collected 209 co-sponsors on a bill to ban the slaughter or export of U.S. horses for human consumption. \"We view horses as athletes and entertainers,\" Sweeney said. \"The American psyche is shocked by the notion that we are going to so inhumanely treat such an important part of our culture.\" Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., a veterinarian who introduced a matching bill in the Senate last week, called the slaughter for human consumption of nearly 50,000 of the nation's 7 million horses last year \"barbaric.\" To draw attention to the equine issue, Sweeney and actress Bo Derek, who rode to fame on horseback in the movie 10, combed the halls of Capitol Hill last week and plan to do so again this week. Also lobbying lawmakers are actor Tony Curtis and his wife, Jill, who founded a horse rescue farm in Las Vegas. Derek, an avid rider, says she was \"shocked to find out that horses are being slaughtered not for countries that have a famine, but for gourmet meals.\" \"We're giving these magnificent animals a hideous death,\" Derek said in an interview. \"No one knows it's happening.\" Curtis said he started to love horses when he began his film career. \"The history of horses on our continent is extraordinary,\" Curtis said. \"We wouldn't have discovered America the way we did without horses.\" U.S. soldiers and some civilians ate horse meat during World War II when beef was scarce, but now virtually all of U.S. slaughtered horse meat is shipped to Europe, primarily Belgium, France and Switzerland, as well as Russia and Mexico. While a dozen horse slaughter plants dotted this country 20 years ago, now there are just two in Texas, the Dallas Crown firm in Kaufman and Beltex Corp. in Fort Worth. Another horse-meat plant, Cavel International, is under construction in DeKalb, Ill., which has catapulted the issue into the state legislature. Texas banned horse slaughter for human consumption in 1949, but the law was never enforced. In 2002, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, now a Republican U.S. senator, issued an opinion saying that the 1949 law outlawing the sale, possession and transfer of horse meat for human consumption was still in effect. Tarrant County has filed suit in federal court to close the slaughterhouses. John Linebarger, an attorney representing both Texas slaughterhouses, said a lot of the horses are unwanted and sold to the plants for an average of $300 to $400. \"Some people would otherwise let these things die in the fields and rot,\" Linebarger said. Linebarger said horseflesh is very lean and is lower in cholesterol and fat than white meat chicken, which is why many Japanese and European physicians recommend it. \"Horses aren't bred as a food item and so they aren't filled with hormones and chemicals,\" Linebarger said.  __________________________________________________________________________", "date": ["1949", "20 years ago", "2002", "last week", "last year", "this week"], "money": ["$300", "$300 to $400", "$400", "$300 to $400"], "place": ["America", "Belgium", "Capitol Hill", "DeKalb", "Europe", "Fort Worth", "France", "Ill.", "Japan", "Las Vegas", "Mexico", "Nev", "Russia", "Switzerland", "Tarrant County", "Texas", "WASHINGTON", "Wild West", "Kentucky", "Dallas", "U.S.", "Nev.", "N.Y"], "person": ["Bo Derek", "Congressional Horse Caucus", "Jill", "John Cornyn", "John Linebarger", "John Sweeney", "Tony Curtis"], "organization": ["Cavel International", "Kaufman and Beltex Corp.", "then- Texas"]}, {"docID": "20040503-2_15", "docDate": "May 5 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "OPINION -- Exposing environmental programs usually brings an attack fromthe green direction.

Both sides are in agreement that the elephants named Lulu and Tinkerbelle should be relocated to a larger outdoor facility where the animals will have more room to roam. Newly hired Zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo announced the zoo's intention to move the elephants at today's meeting and said the elephants would probably only return to the zoo if a greatly expanded facility for them could be constructed. Mollinedo said he would like to see the remaining elephants moved within the next six months, pending approval of a new home by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association. According to Mollinedo, the association's approval is necessary in order for the zoo to remain accredited. Activists, including members of In Defense of Animals and the city's Animal Control and Welfare Commission, took issue with the zoo's six-month time frame, and with the zoo's willingness to let the AZAA choose the elephants' new home. Board President Matt Gonzalez, explaining the activists' point of view, said that there is \"a sense of urgency\" about the issue, because many feel that conditions at the zoo led to the other elephants' premature deaths and could lead to the same fate for the remaining two. __________________________________________________________________________", "date": ["next six months", "past two months", "today"], "time": "this morning", "place": ["SAN FRANCISCO", "San Francisco"], "person": ["American Zoo", "Matt Gonzalez", "Zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo", "Lulu"], "organization": ["Animal Control and Welfare Commission", "Aquarium Association", "Board of Supervisors City Services Committee"]}, {"docID": "20040503-3_39", "docDate": "May 7 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "CALGARY -- Three Canadian slaughterhouses were found in contempt of Parliament yesterday for refusing to give financial documents to a committee probing allegations that beef packers gouged ranchers to rake in huge profits during the mad-cow crisis.In an unusual move, MPs voted unanimously to find Cargill Foods, Lakeside Packers and Levinoff Meats guilty of contempt for ignoring the committee on agriculture and agrifoods' repeated requests for records and extended the deadline -- for a third and final time -- to Monday at noon.\"If they've got nothing to hide, then they should be forthcoming,\" said committee member Dick Proctor, a New Democrat from Saskatchewan.This little-used sanction could mean fines and even jail time for miscreants.It was last handed to disgraced former privacy commissioner George Radwanski in November for misleading the House of Commons, but he avoided the penalty after making a last-minute apology.The last time the measure was used with any real impact was in 1913, when a parliamentary committee witness was sent to jail for refusing to answer questions.\"It's not punishment we're seeking, it's compliance,\" committee chairman and Liberal MP Paul Steckle said.Federal and provincial governments pledged about $2.5-billion in aid to help beef producers in the wake of last year's discovery of a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as BSE or mad-cow disease, but cattle prices still plummeted while the cost of meat at the grocery store didn't fall.\"Something is not right.

Warning for your animal's health:         I recently had a neighbor who had to have their 5-year old German  Shepherd dog put down due to liver failure. The dog was completely  healthy until a few weeks ago, so they had a necropsy done to see  what the cause was. The liver levels were unbelievable, as if the  dog had ingested poison of some kind. The dog is kept inside, and  when he's outside, someone's with him, so the idea of him getting  into something unknown was hard to believe. My neighbor startedgoing  through all the items in the house. When he got to the Swiffer  Wetjet, he noticed, in very tiny print, a warning which stated \"may  be harmful to small children and animals.\" He called the company to  ask what the contents of the cleaning agent are and was astoundedto  find out that anitfreeze is one of the ingredients. (actually hewas  told it's a compound which is one molecule away from anitfreeze).  Therefore, just by the dog walking on the floor cleaned with the  solution, then licking it's own paws, and the dog eating from its  dishes which were kept on the kitchen floor cleaned with this  product, it ingested enough of the solution to destroy its liver.  Soon after his dog's death, his housekeepers' two cats also died of  liver failure. They both used the Swiffer Wetjet for quick cleanups  on their floors.

But is it also pathologically insane? That is the provocative conclusion of an award-winning documentary film, called \u201cThe Corporation\u201d, coming soon to a cinema near you. People on both sides of the globalisation debate should pay attention. Unlike much of the soggy thinking peddled by too many anti-globalisers, \u201cThe Corporation\u201d is a surprisingly rational and coherent attack on capitalism's most important institution.It begins with a potted history of the company's legal form in America, noting the key 19th-century legal innovation that led to treating companies as persons under law. By bestowing on them the rights and protections that people enjoy, this legal innovation gave the company the freedom to flourish. So if the corporation is a person, ask the film's three Canadian co-creators, Mark Achbar, Joel Bakan and Jennifer Abbott, what sort of person is it?The answer, elicited over two-and-a-half hours of interviews with left-wing intellectuals, right-wing captains of industry, economists, psychologists and philosophers, is that the corporation is a psychopath. Like all psychopaths, the firm is singularly self-interested: its purpose is to create wealth for its shareholders. And, like all psychopaths, the firm is irresponsible, because it puts others at risk to satisfy its profit-maximising goal, harming employees and customers, and damaging the environment. The corporation manipulates everything. It is grandiose, always insisting that it is the best, or number one. It has no empathy, refuses to accept responsibility for its actions and feels no remorse. It relates to others only superficially, via make-believe versions of itself manufactured by public-relations consultants and marketing men. In short, if the metaphor of the firm as person is a valid one, then the corporation is clinically insane.There is a tendency among anti-globalisers to demonise captains of industry. But according to \u201cThe Corporation\u201d, the problem with companies does not lie with the people who run them. Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, a former boss of Shell, comes across in the film as a sympathetic and human character.

(05/10/04) Plump whole chickens, choice cuts of beef, fresh grains, and all the wholesome nutrition your dog or cat will ever need. These are the images pet food manufacturers promulgate through the media and advertising. This is what the $11 billion per year U.S. pet food industry wants consumers to believe they are buying when they purchase their products. This report explores the differences between what consumers think they are buying and what they are actually getting. It focuses in very general terms on the most visible name brands -- the pet food labels that are mass-distributed to supermarkets and discount stores -- but there are many highly respected brands that may be guilty of the same offenses. What most consumers don't know is that the pet food industry is an extension of the human food and agriculture industries. Pet food provides a market for slaughterhouse offal, grains considered \"unfit for human consumption,\" and similar waste products to be turned into profit. This waste includes intestines, udders, esophagi, and possibly diseased and cancerous animal parts. (for footnote references, click here). Three of the five major pet food companies in the United States are subsidiaries of major multinational companies: Nestl? (Alpo, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Mighty Dog, and Ralston Purina products such as Dog Chow, ProPlan, and Purina One), Heinz (9 Lives, Amore, Gravy Train, Kibbles-n-Bits, Nature's Recipe), Colgate-Palmolive (Hill's Science Diet Pet Food). Other leading companies include Procter & Gamble (Eukanuba and Iams), Mars (Kal Kan, Mealtime, Pedigree, Sheba, Waltham's), and Nutro. From a business standpoint, multinational companies owning pet food manufacturing companies is an ideal relationship. The multinationals have increased bulk-purchasing power; those that make human food products have a captive market in which to capitalize on their waste products, and pet food divisions have a more reliable capital base and, in many cases, a convenient source of ingredients. There are hundreds of different pet foods available in this country. And while many of the foods on the market are similar, not all of the pet food manufacturing companies use poor quality or potentially dangerous ingredients. Ingredients Although the purchase price of pet food does not always determine whether a pet food is good or bad, the price is often a good indicator of quality. It would be impossible for a company that sells a generic brand of dog food at $9.95 for a 40-lb. bag to use quality protein and grain in its food. The cost of purchasing quality ingredients would be much higher than the selling price. The protein used in pet food comes from a variety of sources. When cattle, swine, chickens, lambs, or other animals are slaughtered, the choice cuts such as lean muscle tissue are trimmed away from the carcass for human consumption. However, about 50% of every food-producing animal does not get used in human foods. Whatever remains of the carcass -- bones, blood, intestines, lungs, ligaments, and almost all the other parts not generally consumed by humans -- is used in pet food, animal feed, and other products. These \"other parts\" are known as \"by-products,\" \"meat-and-bone-meal,\" or similar names on pet food labels. The Pet Food Institute -- the trade association of pet food manufacturers -- acknowledges the use of by-products in pet foods as additional income for processors and farmers: \"The growth of the pet food industry not only provided pet owners with better foods for their pets, but also created profitable additional markets for American farm products and for the byproducts of the meat packing, poultry, and other food industries which prepare food for human consumption.\"1 Many of these remnants provide a questionable source of nourishment for our animals. The nutritional quality of meat and poultry by-products, meals, and digests can vary from batch to batch. James Morris and Quinton Rogers, two professors with the Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California at Davis Veterinary School of Medicine, assert that, \"There is virtually no information on the bioavailability of nutrients for companion animals in many of the common dietary ingredients used in pet foods. These ingredients are generally by-products of the meat, poultry and fishing industries, with the potential for a wide variation in nutrient composition. Claims of nutritional adequacy of pet foods based on the current Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutrient allowances ('profiles') do not give assurances of nutritional adequacy and will not until ingredients are analyzed and bioavailability values are incorporated.\"2  __________________________________________________________________________", "date": "05/10/04", "money": ["$11 billion", "$9.95", "$11 billion", "$9.95"], "place": ["Mars", "United States", "Waltham", "U.S."], "person": ["James Morris", "Kal Kan", "Quinton Rogers", "Sheba", "Iams"], "organization": ["Davis Veterinary School of Medicine", "Department of Molecular Biosciences", "Pet Food Institute", "Procter & Gamble", "University of California at Davis Veterinary School of Medicine", "Eukanuba"]}, {"docID": "20040510_38", "docDate": "May 10 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Undated ?

Azucena (out of dogmeat) is an exotic food, widely eaten by Filipinos both in cities and rural areas because it is affordable and sometimes free. And as part of the exotic fiasco, stealing a neighbor?s dog is part of the whole process. Early during morning, the men from   dog pounds  are already roving the streets, looking or hunting for stray dogs?creatures that are candidates for being an azucena. Even in the earlier days, people from Northern Luzon, practice dog hunting, and cooking to feed prisoners from other tribes. For so, the custom of eating of man?s best friend has been going on for a long time?mostly prevalent to our brothers in the Mountain Province.  According to the writings of the Commissioner of Health in 1905, Mr. Victor Heiser, On the Benguet Road I often see Filipinos bound for the Saturday dog market at Baguio, each dragging along on a leash. This custom is however ruled out, at present, by ordinances and laws of pro-life organizations. However, in reality, people still eat dogs in the outskirts of Sagada, and illegal restaurants in Pangasinan; more or less, dog dishes like mechado and adobo are served in demand. Not to mention, even in progressive cities, despite laws and tight availability.Usually Drunkards who can?t wait for regular dogmeat peddlers, dognap their neighbors? pets, or dogs wandering the streets. Dog thieves snatch the poor animal, and load it into a sack and kill it by striking a hard material on its head; then roast it over an open fire?a procedure to easily brush off the fur. Then, they wash the meat and cook it in their own preference. Caldereta, and adobo are some the most favorite Azucena dishes, and go best with beer or gin.Another way of preparing it is starving the poor animal, then feeding it with rice until its belly bulge, full, before a swift kill, followed by the roasting method. After roasting, the undigested rice inside the dog?s stomach will be steamed naturally. Soon after, the coal-blistered animal?s belly is cut, open, and the rice will be eaten as a festive meal. It is said to be the greatest delicacy in the old days. Some lop its head, letting the blood flow, then cut its body open, the innards are removed and  usually cooked into tinumis. While its raw skin and liver are soaked in vinegar, garlic and onions, and made into kinilaw. Also, Dog blood is believed to be nutritious and beneficial to TB patients. Sufferers insert a straw into the animals jugular vein, to immediately suck the blood fresh. Also, as a myth, azucena is noted to be a great aphrodisiac, making the body extremely hot.

But public comments are running roughly10-1 in favor of keeping the ban, an AP review found.The USDA issued the ban in December after a Holsteincow tested positive for mad cow disease in Washingtonstate, the first reported case in the United States.The department's Food Safety and Inspection Servicemaintains that the cow was a downer - one too sick tostand or walk on its own - although some witnesseshave challenged that.Under the ban, downer cows may not be slaughtered forhuman consumption. Such animals must be condemned.The USDA just finished a public comment period onwhether to keep, scrap or revise the ban. TheInspection Service's acting administrator, BarbaraMasters, will make that decision, although there is notime frame, agency spokesman Steven Cohen said.The AP review covered written comments currently onfile at the USDA, but the agency has not yet filed allthe comments it has received. Those received by e-mailare also not on file.People who eat meat contaminated by mad cow disease -formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, orBSE - can get a fatal variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakobdisease.Supporters of the ban cite health concerns andcompassion as reasons to keep it in place. Cattlegroups, meanwhile, argue the ban should apply todiseased animals, but not to injured ones, which thegroup says pose no health risk to humans.\"If these (injured) animals are condemned, rather thanslaughtered, then producers will suffer an unnecessaryeconomic loss,\" the National Milk Producers Federationwrote. \"Condemning animals suffering from a physicalinjury such as a broken leg does not seem to besupported by science with respect to BSE risk.\"The group, based in Arlington, Va., acknowledges thatdowner cows have a higher risk for mad cow disease.But it says human health would not be jeopardized ifthe USDA allowed injured cattle to be slaughtered forfood, provided they are tested for disease first. Most\"downers\" are old dairy cows whose meat can bringfarmers a little extra revenue.Wisconsin, which is second in the nation in dairyproduction, also urged the USDA to allow consumptionof injured cattle. The state's director of meat safetyand inspection, Terry Burkardt, called condemninganimals with broken bones \"a waste of wholesome foodand an economic burden\" on small farmers and meatestablishments.Burkardt estimated the rule would preclude 3,000\"otherwise healthy, freshly-injured cattle\" from theWisconsin food supply, or about 2.4 million pounds ofmeat a year.North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arizona and West Virginiafiled similar comments.The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, based inCentennial, Colo., asked the USDA to allow for thepersonal (as opposed to commercial) consumption ofdowner cattle injured during transport.Jeffrey Farris of Ellsworth, Wis., who slaughterslivestock on farms, said his business has suffered inthe ban's wake.\"I don't have a problem with the ban on 'sick'downers, but what about the 'healthy' animal thatslips and falls, and either breaks a leg or 'splitsout?'\" wrote Farris. \"Those animals don't haveanything to do with BSE, so why the ban onslaughtering them?\"In an interview, Farris said about 30 percent of hisbusiness comes from downer animals. He's had to layoff two of his six employees because of the ban.The Humane Society of the United States argues thatany weakening of the ban would both pose a health riskand subject cows to suffering. The Washington-basedgroup says USDA veterinarians would be hard-pressed totell if a cow with a broken bone is disease-free.\"It would be impossible for them to determine whethera physical injury is derivative of a neurologicaldisorder or other illness,\" the Humane Society wrote.\"It is well established that illness and injury areoften interrelated.\"The group called the use of downer cattle \"one of theugliest aspects of modern agriculture,\" noting thatsuch animals are often dragged in chains or pushed inbulldozers. It says downers should be euthanizedhumanely rather than brought to slaughterhouses.The Humane Society got many of its members to weigh induring the public comment period.

Being vegan is not about being perfect and causing no cruelty atall-it's about decreasing suffering as effectively as possible. We all know this, but it bears repeating: At some level, everything weconsume harms some animals. Every non-organic thing we eat involvespesticides that kill birds and other small animals. Organic foods use animalfertilizer. Harvesting vegan foods kills and displaces animals. Bike tiresand even \"vegan\" shoes contain some small amount of animal product.

Ultimately, veganism can't just be about us, or itwill become just one more narcissistic cultural fad.

Four decades ago, hunters off the coast of Washington found a perfect young killer whale specimen swimming with its mother. They fired a harpoon, hoping to attach a buoy to the bigger animal that would make trailing them easier. But the spear went in deep and the mother whale drowned. The crew made a deal for the young whale with SeaWorld. The company today says it did not know about the capture. But it did calculate correctly that crowds would come to its San Diego park for the chance to see a killer whale, eventually named Shamu, up close. The modern marine park industry began with the death of Shamu's mother. Since then, the splashing stars have delighted millions. In the United States alone, more than 50 million people visit marine attractions, spending more than $1 billion a year. That entertainment has come at a continuing price to animals.

Middle School students plant bay grasses, which young striped bass and crabs use as a haven and which are a food source for other animals. Almost a third of the underwater grasses in Chesapeake Bay died during 2003, unable to survive as pollution blotted out their sunlight, a report says.E-mail this articlePrint this articleSearch archiveMost e-mailed articlesRelated storiesAsian oyster: Pearl or peril for ecosystem?MANOR TOWNSHIP, Pa. \u2014 The sailboat harbors and crabbing grounds of the Chesapeake Bay are miles from this shallow stream that runs through fields reeking of manure. But the problems of the west branch of Little Conestoga Creek in Lancaster County become the bay's problems, sooner or later. The animal waste that washes into the water here contains pollutants that eventually are carried into the Susquehanna River and then into the bay, where they feed blooms of harmful algae. \"It's all based on a very sophisticated scientific principle: Water runs downhill,\" said William Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \"The Chesapeake Bay is downhill from Pennsylvania.\" The Keystone State does not have an inch of Chesapeake waterfront. But it is a major source of the bay's pollution, because Pennsylvania includes so much of the watershed for the Susquehanna, a massive river that provides half the bay's fresh water. A partner in the bay-cleanup effort since 1983, Pennsylvania dumps more nitrogen into the bay than Maryland or Virginia, which border the estuary, and has made far less progress than those states in reducing the flow of nitrogen and phosphorus, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said. In particular, environmental groups have said, Pennsylvania does little to monitor how small farms spread manure on their fields and allow it to run off into tributaries leading to the bay. Lancaster County, home to 336,000 cows and some Amish farmers who use only manure for fertilizer, has become the epicenter of the state's water pollution. So without changes in Pennsylvania, especially in Lancaster, the movement to save the Chesapeake cannot succeed, environmentalists have said. Last month, the state's voters approved a $250 million bond issue to improve sewer and water systems that contribute to bay pollution. And state regulators have proposed new rules to control phosphorus in runoff from farms. Pennsylvania officials also submitted to the EPA a strategy for cleaning the state's rivers. The strategy included plans to increase forest land and to plant \"cover crops\" \u2014 which hold down soil in farmland during the winter. The EPA estimated that Pennsylvania contributes 39 percent of the pollutant nitrogen that flows annually into the bay. Pennsylvania also sends down large amounts of phosphorus, another key pollutant that \u2014 like nitrogen \u2014 is found in fertilizer. Even so, the EPA said Pennsylvania is only 23 percent of the way to its goals, compared with Maryland's 57 percent and Virginia's 35 percent. Pennsylvania also trails Maryland and Virginia in terms of progress on phosphorus. Once in the bay, nitrogen and phosphorus are food for large algae blooms, which block sunlight needed by underwater plants and consume large amounts of oxygen. The result is water in which fish can't live and crabs leap into the air to avoid suffocation. Although Pennsylvania acted in the early 1990s to monitor the pollutants coming from its large farms, environmentalists have said the other states now do more. Maryland has the most elaborate monitoring system, with farmers required to present a fertilizer-use plan to the state. The General Assembly also has addressed the other major source of pollution in the bay: wastewater-treatment plants. Last month, lawmakers in Annapolis approved a sewer surcharge that will provide a steady flow of revenue to improve the treatment of wastewater, something without parallel in Pennsylvania or Virginia. Pennsylvania officials contend the EPA's estimates haven't accounted for some of the progress the state has made in cleaning up the Susquehanna. Environmentalists working in the state said Pennsylvania has a strong agricultural lobby and that no watermen's groups would reap the bounty of oysters, crabs and rockfish in a cleaned-up bay. In addition, the state's main centers of population \u2014 Pittsburgh and Philadelphia \u2014 are outside the bay's watershed. Lancaster County contains the watershed for the Conestoga River, which is one of the most polluted in the Chesapeake watershed. In the county, progress has been uneven. The county's concentrated dairy- and beef-cattle operations are producing more manure than its crops can absorb as fertilizer, but there is nowhere else to put the waste, activists have said, so on the field it goes. The county's many Amish farmers present a particular problem because they do not use commercial fertilizer, Lancaster officials have said. The result of the animal-waste runoff is evident in the west branch of the Little Conestoga, a tributary of the Conestoga River. In a brown, cloudy creek like this one, the muck on the stream bottom can smell like sewage. Such groups as the Little Conestoga Watershed Alliance have worked with farmers to use fences to keep cows out of streams, create a buffer zone of undergrowth near streams and decrease the spreading of manure. But many farmers, not wanting to yield a competitive advantage, are not easily convinced. \"You're barely making it as it is,\" said Earl Newcomer, a retired Lancaster County farmer who has worked with conservation groups. \"If you change it, it might get worse.\" Another problem is when farmland is replaced by dense housing or shopping malls, environmentalists have said. Acres of concrete prevent rainwater from soaking into the soil and spread pollution from water and mud runoff. Those who have worked on the problem here in Lancaster said their job is tougher because the problem is so diffuse: It's not a single factory belching technicolor ooze. \"You don't have any real major problem,\" in Lancaster, just a thousand smaller problems such as farms, houses and shopping malls, said Mark Metzler, a scientist who has studied the Little Conestoga. \"But when you put them all together, you get a good-sized mess,\" he said. As Pennsylvania's efforts to deal with pollution continue, the state faces a deadline. For decades, much of the sediment washed out of Pennsylvania has not actually flowed into the Chesapeake \u2014 instead, it has piled up as silt behind the Susquehanna's dams: Safe Harbor and Holtwood in Pennsylvania and Conowingo in northern Maryland. All the dams but the giant Conowingo are full, said Robert Walter, a research associate at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster. By 2020, he said, the Conowingo, too, is expected to hit its limit, and all of Pennsylvania's runoff will be spilling into the bay. \"When that last dam is filled,\" Walter said, \"that's going to be a catastrophic release.\"", "organization": ["U.S. Environmental Protection Agency", "EPA"], "place": ["Chesapeake Bay", "Philadelphia", "Pennsylvania", "Lancaster", "Annapolis", "Virginia", "Maryland", "Pa.", "Md."], "date": ["early 1990s", "Last month", "winter", "Friday", "2020", "2003", "1983", "May"], "person": ["Marshall", "William", "Robert"], "money": "$250"}, {"docID": "20040531_86", "docDate": "Jun 2 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "PARIS - Gendarmes in eastern France have dismantled an elaborate poaching network which has been preying on a protected species and much-prized delicacy: the frog. Seven people have been arrested, accused of conspiring to evade French laws establishing quotas and closed seasons for the catching of pool frogs and edible frogs, whose legs have been a staple of French cuisine for centuries. A restaurateur in the Haute-Saone area of Franche-Comte, near the Swiss border, is also said to be facing possible legal action for buying contraband grenouilles de pays, or local frogs. Gendarmes and wildlife protection officials say this is the first time that an entire poaching network - from the frog-catchers to the processors and traders to the restaurateurs - has been dismantled in this way. The small, green and sometimes reddish frogs whose legs can be eaten have become relatively rare in France, but are still abundant in some areas. More than 90 per cent of the market is now supplied by frogs imported from Eastern Europe. Gourmets insist, however, that these do not have the true flavour of the domestic French frog, which can fetch up to 0.25 (16p) a time. One night's illegal frog fishing can net up to 1,000 frogs - worth 250 on the black market. French wildlife protection laws allow wild pool frogs and edible frogs to be caught for personal use only, in the frog-hunting season between May and September. Frogs are also farmed under strictly enforced quotas. Beating this system has now become an elaborate industry, said Didier Ory, head of the enforcement brigade for the French fisheries protection service in the Haute-Saone. \"Frogs are being poached in their thousands, threatening not just their survival, but the whole ecosystem.\" French frogs are regarded as \"richer in taste\" than Eastern European frogs, said Michel Couturier, a fish and frog farmer in Burgundy. \"When producers cannot meet demand, restaurateurs deal with poachers,\" he said.

Some, like the mountain gorillas, only number a few hundred.Most of the orphans are victims of the bushmeat trade, their parents killed by poachers.

What better time to revisit the topic of mad cow disease? Before you plop that slab of Ol' Bossie on the grill, before you slather up that rack of beef ribs with Joe Bob's Country BBQ sauce, take a moment to think about what you will be eating.Several months ago, this column went into some detail about thepossibility that mad cow disease (or BSE) may have already infectedAmerica's food supply. Knappster took considerable grief from mycarnivorous friends who now regard me as a pinko, semi-vegetarian cowsympathizer. A few of them growled and complained about their God-givenright to swallow chewy flank steak, to guzzle gristle, ravage ribs,masticate bull testicles, to kill and eat anything with four or morelegs. They suspect that I raised the mad cow issue as part of asurreptitious animal welfare campaign.Admittedly, there are animal welfare issues involved. The things that aredone to docile cows in the name of hamburger are mind boggling andrevolting. However, the more pressing issue for humans is the healthquestion. Is the American beef supply reasonably safe and free of BSE?Since my last article on this topic, several disturbing things havehappened.Anyone remember Dave Louthan? He's the guy who discovered the firstAmerican mad cow case back in December. A few weeks later, Louthan wasfired from his job at a Washington meat plant where he had worked forfour years.The reason Dave was fired is because he dared to tell reportersthat--contrary to official pronouncements--the mad cow in question hadbeen ground up into hamburger and had already been eaten by consumers.More chilling, he told people that the BSE-infected cow was not aso-called downer cow, but, rather, had been up and walking around when itwas slaughtered. The reason this is so scary is that America's first lineof defense against BSE cattle is to weed out downer or disabled cows, tokeep them from becoming dinner. The USDA requires very little BSEtesting, so it is up to the meat packers to pick out the sick animals andkeep them out of the food chain. ----------", "date": ["December", "summer"], "place": ["America", "Washington"], "person": ["Dave", "Dave Louthan", "God"], "organization": ["Country BBQ", "Joe Bob", "USDA"]}, {"docID": "20040607-2_27", "docDate": "Jun 10 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "The China PostConsumers in Taiwan are advised to make careful examination when they purchase vegetarian products since as high as 70 percent of such food products are found to have animal ingredients.

In the past few years, Japan has been hit by a series of food scares and food-safety scandals, including the outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and bird flu, revelations about large amounts of residual pesticides in vegetables imported from China and various food mislabeling scandals. These problems are all part of the evils of today's efficiency-oriented system for mass-producing and mass-consuming foods as if they were industrial goods. These episodes have naturally made Japanese consumers quite uneasy about the safety of foods they consume. But many consumers are surprisingly ignorant about food safety issues. When BSE makes headlines, they stop eating beef. When bird flu makes a splash on front pages, they avoid buying chicken and eggs. Consumers' response to such news, however, is mostly temporary, and they quickly forget the problems. Japanese consumers' concern is often directed only at matters reported in the media but not at real issues behind the news. No case of bird flu infection in humans from eating chicken or eggs has been reported in the world. Still, many people in Japan are currently feeling ill at ease about eating eggs or chicken. What these people should know is that chickens are grown in very poor conditions in many of today's chicken farms, often in crowded, windowless poultry houses. And some scientific studies have found that chickens that lay eggs under these stressful circumstances often have a disease in such organs as the larynx, the ovary, the liver and the air sac. It makes little sense to fret only about bird flu while turning a blind eye to this and other serious problems with chicken farming. BSE also represents only an extremely small health risk for Japanese consumers, who don't eat such dangerous parts as the brain or the eye. Moreover, unlike Britain, which started a serious effort to prevent the spread of the disease to humans only after more than 160,000 cows had become infected, Japan took steps to contain the disease immediately after the first case was discovered. Rather than worrying about BSE, Japanese consumers should be more concerned about the widespread use of synthetic hormones for growth promotion by American cattle growers as well as the abuse of antibiotics in the livestock industry, which is causing proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.   ********************************************************", "date": ["June 12,2004", "today"], "place": ["Britain", "China", "Japan"]}, {"docID": "20040607-3_22", "docDate": "Jun 12 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "My neighbor Mike is a 1,000-yard sharpshooter.

Elephants visit almost every major urban center in Thailand, including the edges of sprawling Bangkok, begging for food. The Asian elephant may still be a revered cultural icon in this country, gracing bas-reliefs of temples and serving as the royal emblem of the monarchy, but these days, it is woefully unemployed. Worse, in a country whose civilization was more or less built on its back, the elephant is fast disappearing. More than 100,000 existed at the beginning of last century. At the beginning of the 21st, there were fewer than 5,000 -- 2,000 of them still in the wild. Now classified as an endangered species, the Asian elephant is expected to disappear from the country altogether -- except perhaps in zoos and a few nature reserves -- around 2050. There are many reasons why Asian elephants are disappearing, but the main culprit -- the scourge of all wildlife -- is deforestation. For domesticated elephants, deforestation means that they no longer have jobs. Logging in Thailand's forests have always relied on the power of powerful pachyderms.

Molotov cocktails ignited sport-utility vehicles in Virginia. Graffiti coated a dozen SUVs in Santa Fe, N.M. All in the name of Mother Earth -- and all apparently the work of a shadowy environmental group known as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF).In its ongoing guerrilla campaign to promote its environmentalist agenda, ELF has claimed responsibility for more than a dozen acts of sabotage across the nation in the past year, causing more than $60 million in damage. ELF sees unbridled capitalism leading to uncontrolled suburban sprawl and believes the SUV epitomizes the over-consumption that is running amok in the United States. Federal and local law enforcement authorities say the group's attacks are becoming more frequent and more destructive. No longer content to direct their wrath at lumberjacks cutting trees deep in the forest, members of ELF -- known as elves -- are increasingly targeting suburbia, especially the new developments that are encroaching on wilderness.When a $50 million condominium complex under construction in San Diego was torched last summer, in what authorities are calling the most destructive act of eco-terrorism on U.S. soil, investigators discovered a banner at the site. It read: \"If you build it, we will burn it.\" It was signed: \"The E.L.F.s are mad.\"The loosely organized underground movement is continuing to frustrate law enforcement officials across the country. Only a few arrests have been made in the past five years, and there have been even fewer convictions. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in rewards have been offered by authorities, and additional FBI agents have been assigned to investigations involving the group. Unlike traditional criminal enterprises such as the mob or biker gangs with rigid hierarchies that have been successfully infiltrated by undercover agents, there is no formal club for officials to break into.Federal investigators and prosecutors have expressed frustration at the difficulties of cracking down on multi-state campaigns of low-level crimes, intimidation and property damage because of a lack of applicable federal laws.\"Law enforcement is geared to catch the common criminal. These people are criminals, but they are not of the common variety,\" said Gary R. Perlstein, a professor in the administration of justice division at Portland State University. \"They've read the law enforcement manuals. They try not to make mistakes.\"ELF's Web site offers links to wide-ranging instructions, from how to build Molotov cocktails to recognizing surveillance by government agents to encrypting computer activity. Arson is the weapon of choice.On its Web site, ELF invites people to commit acts of destruction and e-mail the group detailing their deeds. A claim of responsibility appears on the Web site a few days later. The group urges members to take all necessary precautions against harming humans and animals.Ron Arnold, the author of several books on the environmental movement who coined the term eco-terrorism, said that delaying a claim of responsibility for a few days after the incident is a strategic move by the group to make sure no one was hurt or killed. The FBI has been studying the group's recruiting efforts in recent years. \"These tend to be younger, college-age students with a typically ideological thought process, and they have an idea of the way things should be,\" said Robert Blecksmith, chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section. ELF is divided into cells, ranging from three to 10 members, said Craig Rosebraugh, the group's former spokesman. He said in an interview that members of one cell have no contact with members of another so that they cannot implicate others.In August, vandals claiming to be members of ELF were caught on surveillance tape spray-painting 125 SUVs at car dealerships and homes in the Los Angeles area. The vehicles, which were also firebombed by unknown assailants, were splashed with slogans such as \"Fat, Lazy Americans\" and \"I H pollution.\" Two suspects have fled the country, but agents arrested California Institute of Technology physics graduate student William Jensen Cottrell. Cottrell, 23, has denied being an ELF member. \"I'm not an environmental activist,\" Cottrell said in an interview at the San Bernardino Central Detention Center. \"I'm just environmentally aware. I support some illegal actions for environmental causes basically because writing letters doesn't work. Who are you going to write a letter to? Arnold Schwarzenegger, who owns six Hummers, or George Bush, who comes from the oil industry?\"When he found out he was being investigated by the FBI, Cottrell contemplated fleeing but decided to stay put. He pleaded not guilty in March to nine counts of arson and conspiracy, and faces as much as 35 years in prison if convicted. The trial is scheduled for October.\"If you just run, nothing happens. This way, more attention gets drawn to the problems with the government and their environmental policy,\" Cottrell said. \"Of course, if I get 30 years, I'll think, damn, why didn't I run?\"In one of the most recent prosecutions, a federal jury acquitted Connor Cash, 22, of arson and terrorism charges last month. He had been charged with damaging five homes under construction on Long Island, N.Y. Two admitted ELF members pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with that incident.In March, Canadian authorities arrested Tre Arrow on shoplifting charges in Victoria, B.C. Arrow is wanted by the FBI in connection with the 2001 bombings of several logging and cement trucks in Oregon. He has been on the run since being indicted in 2002 and is seeking refugee status in Canada to avoid extradition to the United States. In January, three Virginia teenagers pleaded guilty to vandalizing fast-food restaurants and damaging construction equipment in 2002 on behalf of ELF. Authorities say they unraveled another ELF plot when they arrested four teenagers in February planning to vandalize SUVs near Richmond.No one has died as a result of any action claimed by ELF, but authorities are concerned that someone will be injured or killed. \"Their goal is to try to maintain this Robin Hood mystique about them. They're not Robin Hood. They are very destructive, and it's just a matter of time before someone dies as a result of their acts,\" said Rep. Scott McInnis (R-Colo.). McInnis represented the Vail area when a 1998 fire at a ski resort there caused $12 million in damage. ELF has claimed responsibility for the fire. The case remains unsolved.And when large-scale arson attacks make the nightly news, the general public tends to lump all the environmentalists together instead of separating the mainstream groups from the radicals, McInnis said. \"This only hurts the message that legitimate environmental groups are trying to put forward.\"", "date": ["1998", "2001", "2002", "August", "February", "January", "March", "October", "last month", "last summer", "past five years", "past year"], "money": ["$12 million", "$50 million", "more than $60 million", "more than $60 million", "$50 million", "$12 million"], "place": ["Canada", "Colo", "LOS ANGELES", "Long Island", "N.M", "N.Y", "Oregon", "Richmond", "San Diego", "Santa Fe", "United States", "Victoria", "Virginia", "Washington", "Los Angeles", "Colo.", "Vail", "U.S."], "person": ["Arnold Schwarzenegger", "Connor Cash", "Connor Cash, 22", "Cottrell, 23", "Craig Rosebraugh", "Gary R.

It depends on what you\u2019re catching. The latest data shows that migratory fish like spring Chinook salmon are as clean as fish get, while resident fish such as small-mouthed bass are often dangerously loaded with polychlorinated biphenyls, toxic pesticides, dioxin and other contaminants.   As for sturgeon, the ancient fish that Gallant and Klopfenstein were pursuing on a recent morning on the Willamette, new tests show that they also contain some toxins, though at much lower levels than bass, carp and other resident fish.   State and county health officials are issuing an updated fish advisory this week and posting new signs along the river warning of the health risks of eating fish caught in the Willamette.   The latest data show that carp contain the most PCBs, at around 2 parts per million, while bass have about 1 part per million and bullhead catfish contain approximately 0.5 parts per million.   Based on those levels of PCBs, scientists are recommending that women beyond childbearing age and healthy men should eat no more than 8 ounces of resident fish from the Willamette per month. Women of childbearing age, children and anyone with a weak immune system or thyroid or liver problems should avoid eating any carp, bass or catfish from the Willamette, according to the health advisory.   The new warnings follow a massive fish collection effort performed two years ago. As part of the Portland harbor Superfund investigation, scientists caught about 1,500 fish from the lower Willamette and sent them off to labs to be tested for 399 chemicals.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency still has not released the results from those tests publicly.

The injured dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Chopper, has been forfeited to the SPCA . \"This was a cruel and vicious attack on poor Chopper, who suffered soft- tissue injuries to his skull, fractured teeth and jaw injuries. There can be no excuses for this kind of wanton cruelty,\" says the Royal New Zealand SPCA's Acting Chief Executive, Jenny Prattley. Mrs Prattley notes that the sentence comes less than two weeks after the New Plymouth District Court sentenced a woman to 300 hours Community Service and ordered her to pay $4,000 in reparations to the SPCA after she was found guilty of failing to care adequately for 21 Persian cats. \"Taken together, these two cases suggest that our courts are starting to take a tougher line with people who are cruel or callous in their treatment of animals. It should be borne in mind that these are still far from draconian sentences when compared to those allowed for by the 1999 Animal Welfare Act. For example, in Chopper's case, his former owner could have faced a fine of $25,000 and/or six months in prison.

The one common denominator is that the bear always weighs \"at least 900 pounds.\"In actuality, most bears in Nevada are about one-third that size, the average is 300 pounds for adult males and 150 pounds for adult females. The bear's size depends in part on what they are eating, which is the whole reason this issue is being discussed. Those bears that primarily eat garbage and other foods made available by humans and are considerably larger than the typical \"wild\" bear. Garbage fed bears gain weight very easily and can weigh almost double what they would if they were eating natural type foods, mainly vegetation. Black bears (the only species of bear in Nevada or California) are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. A black bear's diet is 85 percent vegetation, consisting of grasses, shrubs, flowers, berries and nuts. They will also eat insects of all kinds, small mammals and carrion. They are not supposed to be eating human garbage.There are two common misconceptions surrounding the bears in the Tahoe Basin. First, that the bear population is growing, mainly because people see them more often. Second, that the bears are in the urban areas because they are starving, and therefore must be fed. Both assumptions are wrong, yet understandable to a certain degree.A recent study by both the University of Nevada, Reno and the Nevada Department of Wildlife concluded that the black bear population in Nevada is stable, at about 150-250 animals.This number has not changed significantly over the last 20 years. What has changed is the number of bears that are concentrated in and around the urban areas, such as Incline Village, Cave Rock, Zephyr Cove and Stateline.

The Australian Koala Foundation has written to the government urging it to declare the koala a vulnerable species after a survey of 1,000 koala habitats found 30% no longer had a koala in them and 6% had suffered widespread destruction.  ?I truly believe that in my lifetime the koala will become extinct unless we do something,? says Deborah Tabarat, executive director of the foundation.   Althought the koala has no natural predator, it has been in decline for decades due to urban sprawl and from car accidents and dog attacks. More than 4,000 koalas are killed each year by dogs and cars.Koalas are protected by law but the eucalyptus trees they call home and which provide their only source of food are not. There are about 100,000 koalas in Australia, down from an estimated seven to 10 million at the time of white settlement in 1788. In the 1920s three million koalas were shot for their fur.  Tabarat says the major problem facing koalas is that the majority of Australia?s 20 million people and the majority of the koala population both call Australia?s eastern states home.  She says that with 80% of Australia?s east coast temperate forests destroyed and continued rapid urbanisation, koalas along the eastern seaboard could be extinct in 15 years.  ?This animal is in serious trouble,? says Tabarat. ?In 15 years you will not see a koala west of the divide,? she adds, referring to the Great Australian Divide, mountains that divide east coast Australia from its rural outback.", "date": "1788", "place": "Australia", "person": "Deborah Tabarat", "organization": ["Australia?s east coast", "Australian Koala Foundation"]}, {"docID": "20040621_38", "docDate": "Jun 22 2004", "docSource": null, "docText": "Cattleman Howard F.

Julia Durfee's commentary is spot on in that horses are a part of American culture. There was also a great story on CBS Evening News on the subject of horse slaughter that aired last Wednesday. Mr. Reagan's funeral procession in Washington, D.C., truly shows the stature that horses have in American culture. The caisson that bore his casket was drawn by a team of black horses. Following the caisson was the riderless horse, with the boots turned backward in the stirrups to symbolize a fallen leader who will never again lead his troops into battle. Mr. Reagan was an avid horse lover; he knew the dignity and intelligence that horses possess.I find it ironic that Mr. Goodlatte had stated that he found it to be appalling that other nations were imposing their values upon the U.S. when his Internet gambling bill failed. Yet Mr. Goodlatte turns a blind eye when the Belgian- and French-owned horse-slaughter industry operating here in the U.S. imposes the values of those who eat horsemeat upon our culture. I am among the 91 percent of Americans opposed to horse slaughter. Mr. Goodlatte is defying the will of most of the country by blocking HR 857 in the House Agriculture Committee.The reason Mr. Goodlatte gives for his opposition is that he fears that a ban on horse slaughter will lead to increased horse abuse. This worry is shared by groups such as the American Association of Equine Practitioners. Goodlatte also worries about the care of these unwanted horses costing the government hundreds of millions of dollars.When you really analyze the facts, you can see that these worries are unfounded. Since 1990, the horse-slaughter industry has experienced a drastic decline. In 1990, 345,700.horses were slaughtered. In 2002, the number fell to about 45,000. In this 12-year period, the yearly total of horses slaughtered decreased by anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000. During this time there were no outbreaks of horse abuse and neglect, nor was the government required to step in with financial aid to care for \"unwanted\" horses.Given that the number of horses slaughtered in 2003 is around 50,000 (less than 1 percent of the US horse population of 7,000,000), we could ban this business right now with no adverse effect to the U.S. horse industry.California has led the charge with a state ban on the horsemeat trade. As was stated in Mr. Holland's letter, horse abuse and horse theft have decreased in this state. There are plenty of facts available to back this up.It would seem that Mr. Goodlatte has not done his due diligence as far as researching the horse-slaughter issue based on his inability to comment on the issue when confronted. If he has not studied the statistics, what gives him the right to kill this bill?The fact that 224 of Mr. Goodlatte's House colleagues support HR 857 show that this issue is important to America. More than half of the House is in favor of this bill; it could go to the House floor for a vote today and become law.

He sold the farm years ago, back when pigs lived in pens big enough for Dorothy to tumble into on her way to Oz.In these days of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Mad Cow Disease, the nation's food-safety system involves 10 to 12 regulatory agencies - including the USDA, whose dual mission is promoting agriculture products and regulating food safety - and 30 some laws.Last year, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said, \"We are working under a Meat Inspection Act that pre-dates the Model T.\"Farming, on the other hand, has plowed ahead.It's big business, high volume and fast turnaround.American agriculture is efficient and produces a product that the American consumer enjoys for low prices. Experts say our food is safe. But increasing numbers of people are seeking out food that was produced using more natural means because they believe it is better for their long-term health.Those who run the large concerns derided as \"factory farms\" say their animals are humanely treated. But a number of advocacy groups point to practices such as docking the beaks of chickens so they don't peck each other in crowded cages, or keeping pregnant sows in pens too small to turn around in, that they feel are indicative of a lack of empathy with the nature and needs of the animal.I'm among those who would prefer to have my eggs come from chickens who scratch around outside and nest in comfortably. Call me crazy. But I vote with my dollars.I pay more for food that makes claims like \"cage-free\" or \"free range.\" But the definitions of these things can be squishy. The USDA, which regulates labeling and the use of the term \"organic,\" has been known to try to ease restrictions on how it is used, says Steve Roach of Food Animal Concerns Trust, an animal welfare and food safety group.Animals raised under modern agricultural methods are given antibiotics so routinely that many, including the American Medical Association, have warned that the practice could make antibiotics less effective when people get sick. The General Accounting Office says the practice represents \"an unacceptable risk to the public health\" because it results in antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Olympia Snowe are sponsoring a bill, S 1460, to phase out the routine use of antibiotics in livestock.Up until 1997, dairy cows could be fed parts of other cows. That practice was banned because it is believed that Mad Cow Disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE) is spread that way.But bovine slaughterhouse waste and remains of cows that die on the farm can still be rendered into food for chickens, whose waste is still fed to dairy cows that eventually get shipped to the slaughterhouse and are sold for human consumption. The FDA began talking about banning the practice of feeding chicken litter to cows after a cow with BSE was found in the United States last December. But the ban hasn't happened.Last month, the USDA began a testing program for BSE. Over the next 12 to 16 months, 220,000 cows will be checked.

More than 50 possible cases are being investigated. The disease, which is not usually fatal to humans, has previously been discovered in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana in mid-May.  Most of those affected had contact with prairie dogs - a type of wild rodent which lives in burrows on the western US plains, and sold as pets. A senior official with the Center for Infectious Diseases (CDC) told reporters seven people were in hospital out of \"50 cases of serious illness...under investigation.

Pet shops, distributors, and breeder farms are being investigated.A concern is that the virus could spread to other rodents - especially wild mice and rabbits - and become uncontrollable if established in native species, the CDC says. It has issued instructions to doctors and vets on how to detect symptoms of monkeypox among patients and what measures to take when handling it.

But as the monkeypox outbreak shows, there are risks in owning exotic pets. Now that two people have died from a new, more potent strain, the mishmash of regulations leaves loopholes that have allowed sick animals to travel, health officials say. Chinchillas, believed to be the cause of the recent outbreak and on the endangered species lists, are part of that concern. With so much worldwide travel by both people and animals, health officials expect that such outbreaks will become more and more common, said Dr. David Chelmsworth, a deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who was speaking at a news conference last week.\"In that context, we should expect that these will become more, rather than less, frequent,\" he said, referring to outbreaks.Bruce Longhorn, a professor at Virginia Tech's College of Veterinary Medicine, likens the monkeypox outbreak to SARS, which also passes from animals to humans.\"Did anyone expect SARS?\" Professor Longhorn said. \"There seems to be a trend - just more disease in the world. And a logical explanation is there's so much more travel from continent to continent compared to 50 years ago.\"If monkeypox \"somehow gets released into the wild populations, we've got a disaster on our hands,\" Longhorn said. \"They're struggling to survive.\" His group opposes selling chinchilla as pets and regards the outbreak as \"a not entirely unexpected result,\" he said.Other trendy animals of the last few years include pot-bellied pigs, sugar gliders, hedgehogs and, recently, South American opossums.

He has also been a suspect in radical animal rights activities. Officials believe Gil has fled the country.Mary Ann Ollesen, a business owner in Westminster, Calif., and a member of the Rat and Mouse Club of America, got several Gambian rats a few years ago when their owners gave them up.\"I really don't think they should be kept as pets, because we really don't know much about them,\" she said. \"They get sick and die, and you don't know why.

The Reno Rodeo was to have its  next-to-the-last performance in town on this date to record crowds.  Thinking that the subject was very  topical and thought-provoking, I did some research about how animals are treated  in rodeos across the country.  I  stumbled across a website at _http://www.sharkonline.org/_ (http://www.sharkonline.org/) . I learned of  documented abuse and mistreatment of animals in rodeos, and wanted to find out  more, as well as hear from both sides.  I telephoned the owner of the website, Steve Hindi, and invited him on  the show.  I then learned that the  animal welfare coordinator for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, Cindy  Schonholtz, happen to be in town and I was able to track her down and invite her  onto the show.  She immediately  agreed to appear in person on the show, and got directions on how to get  there.  I then informed her that I  would also have Steve Hindi from SHARK (Showing Animals Respect & Kindness)  on the show with her. At this point she  started backpedaling and told me that she would have to clear it with her  superiors at the PRCA.  Within an  hour, she called back and canceled her appearance.  I then got a call from my boss, General  Manager Dane Wilt of Lotus Radio in  Reno, who was very upset.  He demanded to know whose idea it was to  put an animal rights activist on the air.  I should point out here that Lotus Radio has 5 radio stations in Reno,  including 94.5 The Mountain, a country FM station, which turns out to be the  official radio station of the Reno Rodeo for the past 4 years running.  Since Miss Schonholtz had just canceled  and I wanted to have both sides on the air, coupled with the fact that Dane was  very upset, I told him that I wouldn't put Mr. Hindi on the air and he hung  up. First thing Monday  morning, Dane called me into his office.  He also requested the presence of office manager Tammy Jo Baxter, as he  often does when very serious conversations are about to take place.  He started out this way \"Lee, there is  absolutely no possible way that you can justify what you did on Friday.  The rodeo is our partner.  You have shown no regard for our  relationship with them, etc, etc.  You will never be on the air on KPTT again.  Ever.\" I then tried to  explain my reasons for doing the show to no avail.  I even apologized, saying I used poor  judgment by not consulting with him first.  He was determined to remove me from the air, saying that my apology was  worthless because it didn't come fast enough.  He went on to say that he couldn't trust  me to be on the air ever again.  Since I am also the sales manager of KPTT, I asked how he could trust me  to call on clients if he couldn't trust me to be on the air.  He said that that was different, and I  disagreed.  I told him then that if  he really didn't trust me, I didn't need to be there, and so I resigned.  I reminded him that all of this fuss was  over a show that NEVER EVEN AIRED.  It didn't matter.  He wasn't changing his mind, so I  assured him that I was serious about resigning. Since this occurred,  I have informed a few of my clients about what happened, and they are furious,  some already demanding answers and threatening to cancel many thousands of  dollars worth of advertising.

Hunters pay thousands of dollars to spend a few days tracking and killing these animals, and most ranches guarantee hunters will not go home empty handed.

The wild populations were harvested over a prolonged period of time at a higher rate than the species' reproduction rate. So the extensive human-caused mortality hasto be added to the natural mortality factors. Furthermore the people living in the urbane surroundings were not interested in protecting the species due to the reason that these was for no interest, neither personalnor economic, for them. Even today most of the people living near the RNC (Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas) have never seen a chinchilla.The German-Chilean project ChinChorro was therefore founded to teach youngstudents of the near the reserve located town Illapel (Chile) about the chinchillas to increase future's chance of success that the those students will have a personal interest protecting an animal which isabout to extinct. Another target is to teach the students to respect the natural environment as we all depend on it.(Photo: The ChinChorro students, the Chilean leader of the group Laura Araya Sol\u00eds and a volunteer from the University of Chile, Wladimir Givovich Diaz, in September 2004.)The number of students taking part in the project is now 15. In September 27 students had theirfirst classes about the wild living chinchillas to be well prepared during their first excursion to the RNC. Near the reserve CONAF (National Chilean Forrest Service) had reserved a place inorder to make it possible for the students to plant about 3000 native seedlings. By planting native seed stock they will learn more about the region's nature, CONAF's co-workers arewilling to teach them about the importance of those plants animals living in the reserve depend on.The students are very motivated. They suggested to work on a regular paper for the students attheir school, also they want to teach other students about the wild chinchillas as soon as they are well educated about chinchillas.As there is a urgent need for the reserve to grow because of the existence of colonies of wild living chinchillas outside the protected area where mining and human settlement endanger theanimals it is also our target to motivate tourists to come to Chile in order to spend their holidays in the region around the reserve. An English teacher will be able to guide those environmentaltourists who are interested in a special kind of vacation, and a nearby located travel agency is interested in a increasing number of tourists. A soft natural tourism can cause a positiveinfluence for both, the reserve and the people living near the reserve.Click here to see the first project photos!You want to support the project?

Thechinchilla sleeps in rock crevices or burrows by day. It also escapes into tiny crevices where predators cannot reach.

Kelterbaum, member of a German society for the prevention of the crueltyto animals \u201cStra\u00dfenkatzen K\u00f6ln e.V.\u201d (Streetcats of Cologne) about the problems of castrationQuestion: Do pet owners prefer to castrate the male part of a pair or not?Answer: Most of them think that a castration is too expensive even if they know that the procurement of a young one will cause problems later. You pay approx. 35,- DM (17,50 Euro) for a rabbit at a petshop ..., a castration costs double. If the price of a castration is higher than the price of the pet itself the will to castrate the pet declines.Question: Have you made simular experiences with chinchilla owners?Answer: Many owners of a chinchilla say they do not want to keep (their children) back from the experience of the event of a natural process of reproduction. Under the pretence it would be better to let nature do what nature wants some of them start breeding chinchillas. But it is the chase after money and not the interest of the breeding-animals wich is more important for them.Question: For what reason do exspecially chinchilla owners refuse a castration of their pet?Answer: Some owners lost their chinchilla because of a castration and therefore they are convinced that a chinchilla has not the slightest chance to survive the operation. We always stress that anaesthetic is a risk for every animal (like it is for every human being). In fact, chinchillas are more endangered during this operation than many other animals. But every male which had been castrated by a veterinarian we chose did survive. If you do not trust the veterinarian who is located next you have to choose someone who has already made experiences with the castration of chinchillas.Thank you for this interview![English][Facts worth knowing][Chin of the month][My chins][Guestbook][Vampirillas][Chin Knights][Rodela][Deutsch][Espanol]CopyrightPhotos, drawings, text: S.
